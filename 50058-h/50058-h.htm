<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>SENDING AND RECEIVING INVITATIONS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE sending and receiving of invitations underlies
social obligations. It therefore behooves
both senders and recipients to learn the
proper form in which these evidences of hospitality
should be despatched and received.</p>

<p>In the majority of cases an invitation demands
an answer. If one is in doubt, it is well to err
on the side of acknowledging an invitation, rather
than on that of ignoring it altogether.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We will consider first such invitations as demand
no acceptance but which call for regrets if one can
not accept. Such are cards to “At Home” days,
to teas and to large receptions. Unless any one
of these bears on its face the letters “R. s. v. p.”
(<i>Répondez, s’il vous plaît</i>—Answer if you please)
no acceptance is required. If one can not attend
the function, one should send one’s card so that
one’s friend will receive it on the day of her affair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">CARDS FOR AN AT HOME</div>

<p>The cards for an “At Home” are issued about
ten days before the function. They bear the hostess’
name alone, unless her husband is to receive
with her, in which case the card may bear the two
names, as “Mr. and Mrs. James Smith.” The average
American man does not, however, figure at his
wife’s “At Homes” when these are held in the afternoon.
The exigencies of counting-room and
office hold him in thrall too often for him to be
depended on for such an occasion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A plain, heavy cream card, simply engraved, is
now used for most formal invitations in preference
to the engraved notes that were the rule ten years
ago.</p>

<p>The card bears in the lower right-hand corner
the address of the entertainer; in the lower left-hand
corner the date and the hours of the affair,—as
“Wednesday, October the nineteenth,” and
under this “From four until seven o’clock.”</p>

<p>If the tea be given in honor of a friend, or to
introduce a stranger, the card of this person is
enclosed with that of the hostess, if the affair be
rather informal. If, however, it be a formal reception
it is well to have engraved upon the card
of the hostess, directly under her own name, “To
meet Miss Smith.”</p>

<p>If a woman wishes to be at home for a guest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
unexpectedly arrived, and there is not time for the
engraving of cards, or if she prefers to be informal,
she may simply use her visiting-card, writing
the name of her guest beneath her own, and adding
the date on which she will receive, and the
hours, in the lower left-hand corner. It is understood,
of course, that abbreviations—with the exception
of “P. p. c.” and “R. s. v. p.”—are never
to be used on invitations and social notes.</p>

<p>The recipient, if sending cards instead of attending,
encloses a card for the guest or friend whom
she has been invited to meet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE EVENING RECEPTION</div>

<p>The cards for an evening reception may be issued
in the same style. If not, they are in the
form of a regular invitation, and in the third person,
as:</p>

<p class="center">
“Mr. and Mrs. James Smith<br />
Request the pleasure of Mr. and Mrs.<br />
Brown’s company<br />
On Wednesday evening, October the nineteenth,<br />
From eight to eleven o’clock.<br />
2 West Clark Street.”<br />
</p>

<p>If this formal invitation bears “R. s. v. p.” in
one corner, it should be accepted in the same person
in which it is written, thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. and Mrs. John Brown accept with pleasure
Mr. and Mrs. Smith’s invitation for Wednesday
evening, October the nineteenth.”</p></div>

<p>The reply to an invitation, whether formal or
informal, should, to guard against misunderstanding,
always explicitly repeat the date and the hour.</p>

<p>It is hardly to be supposed that any person who
reads this book will be guilty of the outrageous solecism
of signing his or her name to an invitation
written in the third person. But such things have
been done!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">ABBREVIATIONS AND FIGURES</div>

<p>The letters “R. s. v. p.” are often written or
engraved entirely in capitals. This is incorrect.
Some people prefer to dispense with them altogether
and to express themselves in the simpler fashion,
“The favor of an answer is requested.” It will
be noticed that figures are avoided. The day of
the week, and such words as “street” and “avenue”
must appear in full. Some people even write out
the year in words, but this looks heavy. Never
use “City” or “Town” on an envelope in place of
the name of the city.</p>

<p>To announce an “At Home” through the newspapers
is to be avoided. In case of the sudden descent
of a friend who will remain for two or three
days only it may be done. In that case one must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
add that there are no invitations, otherwise one’s
friends may not understand.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">DANCES AND TEAS</div>

<p>Invitations to dances are often issued in the same
form as those to teas, with “Dancing” written or
engraved in the corner of the card. As with teas,
so with evening receptions, a declinature must be
sent in the shape of a card delivered on the day
of the function. The custom that some persons
follow of writing “Regrets” on such a card is not
good form.</p>

<p>An invitation to a card-party, no matter how
informal, always demands an answer, as the entertainer
wishes to know how many tables to provide,
and the number of players she can count on.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Cards to church weddings demand no answer unless
the wedding be a small one and the invitations
are written by the bride or one of the relatives,
in which case the acceptance or regret must be written
at once, and thanks expressed for the honor.
A “crush” church wedding is the one function that
demands no reply of any kind. If one can go,
well and good. If one does not go one will not
be missed from the crowd that will throng the edifice.
An invitation to a home wedding or a breakfast
demands an answer and thanks for the honor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">ADDRESSING THE ENVELOPES</div>

<p>While on the subject of invitations to large or
formal affairs, it may be well to touch on a point
concerning which many correspondents write letters
of agonized inquiry,—the addressing of envelopes
to the different members of a family. The question,
“May one invitation be sent to an entire family,
consisting of parents, sons and daughters?” is
asked again and again. To each of these an emphatic
“No!” is the answer. If any person is to
be honored by an invitation to a function, he should
be honored by an invitation sent in the proper way.
One card should be sent to “Mr. and Mrs. Blank”;
another to the “Misses Blank,” still another to
each son of the family. One can foresee the day
when each unmarried daughter will expect her own
card, so rapidly is feminine individuality developing.
Each invitation is enclosed in a separate envelope,
but, if desired, all these envelopes may be
enclosed in a larger outer one addressed to the
head of the house.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The most important invitation,—one demanding
an immediate answer,—is that to a dinner or luncheon,
be this formal or informal. For stately formal
dinners, engraved invitations in the third person
are sent. But it is quite as good form, and in
appearance much more hospitable and complimentary,
for the hostess herself to write personal notes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
of invitation to each guest. These may be in the
simplest language, as:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="unindent">“My dear Miss Dorr:</p>

<p>“Will you give Mr. Brown and myself the pleasure
of having you at dinner with us on Thursday
evening, December the sixth? We sincerely hope
that you will be among those whom we see at our
table that night. Dinner will be served at seven
o’clock.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">“Cordially yours,</span><br />
“Louise Brown.”<br />
</p></div>

<p>An invitation to a married woman should always
include herself and her husband, but it is addressed
to her because it is the woman who is supposed
to have charge of the social calendar of the family.
This note may read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="unindent">“My dear Mrs. Aikman:</p>

<p>“Will you and Mr. Aikman honor us by being our
guests at dinner on Thursday evening, December
the sixth, at seven o’clock? Sincerely hoping to see
you at that time, I remain,</p>

<p class="sig">
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">“Cordially yours,</span><br />
“Louise Brown.”<br />
</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">THE SINGLE MAN</div>

<p>A note of invitation to a single man is written
in the same way. If the dinner be given to any
particular guest or guests, this fact should be mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
in the invitation. As, for instance, “Will
you dine with us to meet Mr. and Mrs. Barrows,”
and so forth.</p>

<p>Single men who are warmly appreciative of dinner
invitations and who foresee no opportunity in
the near future to return the hospitality offered to
them, frequently send a box of flowers to their
hostess on the day of her entertainment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE INVITATION TO DINNER</div>

<p>As soon as practicable after the receipt of a
dinner invitation, the recipient should write a cordial
note. If accepting she should express thanks
and the pleasure she (or her husband and she) will
take in being present at the time mentioned. As
a rule the decision to accept or decline should be
as absolute as it is immediate. Only the greatest
intimacy and extraordinary circumstances warrant
the request that an invitation be held open even
for a day. The hostess must make her arrangements
and she can not do so until she has heard
definitely from all those she has asked.</p>

<p>If a declinature is necessary, let it be in the form
of a recognition of the honor conveyed in the invitation,
and genuine regret at the impossibility of
accepting it. This may be worded somewhat in
the following way:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="unindent">“My dear Mrs. Brown:</p>

<p>“Mr. Aikman and I regret sincerely that a previous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
engagement makes it impossible for us to accept
your delightful invitation for December the
sixth. We thank you for counting us among those
who are so happy as to be your guests on that
evening, and only wish that we could be with you.</p>

</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">DINNER ENGAGEMENTS BINDING</div>

<p>No matter how informal a dinner is to be, if
the invitation is once accepted, nothing must be allowed
to interfere with one’s attendance unless one
is so ill that one’s physician absolutely forbids one
leaving the house.</p>

<p>Some wit said that a man’s only excuse for non-attendance
at such a function is his death, in which
case he should send his obituary notice as an explanation.
Certain it is that nothing short of one’s
own severe illness or the dangerous illness of a
member of the family should interfere with one’s
attendance at a dinner. Should such a contingency
arise, a telegram or telephone message should be
sent immediately that the hostess may try to engage
another guest to take the place of the one
who is unavoidably prevented from being present.</p>

<p>When it becomes necessary to ask a guest to fill
such a vacancy, the hostess will do best to explain
the situation frankly, while the guest on his part
need feel no slight at the lateness of his invitation.
A clever woman always has several persons on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
whom she can rely for such emergencies and whose
good nature she does not fail to reward.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LUNCHEON</div>

<p>All the rules that apply to the sending and receiving
of invitations to a dinner prevail with regard
to a luncheon. It is next in importance as
a function, and the acceptance or declinature of
a letter requesting that one should attend it must
be promptly despatched.</p>

<p>In planning any social affair the hostess should
think twice about asking together people who have
for a long time lived in the same neighborhood
or who are old residents of the city in any part
but who are not apparently in the habit of seeing
one another. Sometimes it is safer to ask one’s
prospective guests outright if it will be agreeable
for them to meet.</p>

<p>Before closing this chapter we should like to remind
the possible guest that an invitation is intended
as an honor. The function to which one is asked
may be all that is most boring, and the flesh and
spirit may shrink from attending it. But if one
declines what is meant as a compliment, let one
do so in a manner that shows one appreciates the
honor intended. To decline as if the person extending
the invitation were a bit presumptuous in
giving it, or to accept in a condescending manner,
is a lapse that shows a common strain under a recently-acquired
polish. A thoroughbred accepts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
and declines all invitations as though he were honored
by the attention. In doing so he shows himself
worthy to receive any compliment that may
under any circumstances be extended to him.
Would that more of the strugglers up Society’s ladders
would appreciate this truth!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If a woman wishes to give any other special form
of entertainment than a dance, she writes the suitable
word, “Music,” “Bridge,” “Garden-party,”
etc., in place of the word “Dancing.”</p>

<p>For a dinner dance one sends a note or an engraved
card with “Dancing at ten” or “Cotillion at
eleven” in the corner, to the comparatively small
number asked to dine. The guests asked for the
dance receive only an “At Home” card, with the
announcement “Dancing at ten” in the corner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TEA-DANCE</div>

<p>The tea-dance or <i>thé-dansant</i> has recently been
revived. This calls for an “At Home” card and
the word “Dancing” in the corner. It is merely an
ordinary afternoon tea at which space and music
are provided for the young people to whirl about.</p>

<p>Some people who entertain formally a great deal
keep on hand a supply of large engraved cards with
a space left blank in which the name of the guest
is written. This is certainly a time-saving custom,
but the appearance of such a card is less elegant
than one wholly engraved, while on the other hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
it lacks the real cordiality of the written note. Aiming
at a combined effect, it hardly achieves either of
the things desired.</p>

<p>A minor but amusing blunder sometimes made
by thoughtless persons consists in inviting guests
“for” dinner. The ducks and salad, ices and cakes
are <i>for</i> dinner; the guests should be asked <i>to</i> it.</p>

<p>A woman may take an out-of-town visitor to
any large affair without obtaining permission beforehand,
but she will of course, in speaking to her
hostess, express appreciation of the pleasant opportunity
thus afforded to her guest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">CARDS AFTER A DEATH</div>

<p>After a death has taken place, one will not for a
month or six weeks intrude on the seclusion of the
family by sending any social invitations. After
that time, however, they should be sent as usual. It
is the personal privilege of the bereaved to determine
how soon and to what extent they will resume
their relations with society. If one is in mourning
one can not of course with propriety become a
member of any gay company, but nowadays mourning
is not always assumed even by the most grievously
stricken. If such persons find their burden
more easily borne by the resumption, as far as may
be, of their normal activities, it is the part of kindness
to aid them in making this resumption as easy
and natural as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>It is now considered correct to send all invitations
by mail, though in some southern places the more
elegant—if difficult—method of delivering them by
the hand of a servant is still cherished. Many informal
invitations are now extended by telephone.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">HOW INVITATIONS BEGIN</div>

<p>Dinner and wedding invitations and cards for
evening receptions are issued in the names of both
host and hostess. For a ball or a garden-party the
name of the hostess may appear alone, though this
is not usual. A young girl should never announce
any but the smallest and most informal parties in
her own name. Yet many young girls do so, ignoring
their mothers and contributing unwittingly to
our national reputation for bad manners.</p>

<p>A bishop and his wife, if they are issuing cards
to a large reception, often do it in this way: “The
Bishop of Indiana and Mrs. Hereford request the
honor,” etc.</p>

<p>An invitation should never begin “You are cordially
invited,” etc. It should always be issued in
the name of some person or persons. “The Men’s
Club invites you” or “The Diocesan Society requests
the honor of” is good form.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>CARDS AND CALLS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE styles of calling-cards change from year
to year, even from season to season, so that
it is impossible to make hard-and-fast rules as to
the size and thickness of the bits of pasteboard, or
the script with which they are engraved. Any
good stationer can give one the desired information
on these points.</p>

<p>In choosing a card plate it is well to select a style
of script so simple yet elegant that it will not be
outré several seasons hence, unless one’s purse will
allow one to revise one’s plate with each change of
fashion. It should not be necessary to remark that
a printed card is an atrocity. Even a man’s business-card
should be engraved, not printed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is no longer considered proper for one card
to bear the husband’s and wife’s names together,
as was a few years ago the mode, thus,—“Mr. and
Mrs. Charles Sprague.” Still, some persons have
a few cards thus marked and use them in sending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
gifts from husband and wife. As a rule, however,
the husband’s card is enclosed in an envelope with
that of his wife in sending gifts, regrets and the
like.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CARD OF A MATRON</div>

<p>The card of a matron bears her husband’s full
name unless she is a <i>divorcée</i>, thus,—“Mrs. George
Williams Brown.” Even widows retain this style of
address. In the lower right-hand corner is the address,
and in the lower left-hand corner one’s “at
home” days are named, as “Tuesdays until Lent,”
or “Wednesdays in February and March,” or
“Thursdays until May.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nicknames and abbreviations are for intimate
use only and should never appear on cards or invitations.
A girl should distinguish between “Kitty”
and “Katharine,” “Sarah” and “Sallie.” However,
in the south many girls are christened “Sallie,”
and this is accepted as her full and proper name accordingly.</p>

<p>A young woman’s cards bear her name, “Miss
Blank,” if she be the oldest or only daughter in the
family. The address on her cards is in the lower
left-hand corner. If she has an older sister the
card reads “Miss Mary Hilton Blank.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A man’s card is much smaller than that of a woman
and often has no address on it, unless it be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
a business-card, which must never be used for social
purposes. The “Mr.” is put before the signature
as, “Mr. James John Smith.” By the time a
boy is eighteen he is considered old enough to have
his cards marked with the prefix “Mr.” Until that
time, he is, on the rare occasions when he is formally
addressed, “Master.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE USE OF TITLES</div>

<p>A clergyman’s card is correctly engraved thus:
“The Reverend James Vernon Smith.” A bishop
is entitled to the greater distinction, “The Right
Reverend.” A physician or a judge may use his
title or not as he prefers. Army and navy officers
invariably employ theirs except when the rank
is as low as that of a lieutenant, when the full name,
prefixed by “Mr.” is used, and below it, “Lieutenant
of Third Cavalry, United States Army.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A woman with a daughter-in-law moving in society
in the same city as herself may with propriety
have her card engraved simply “Mrs. Brown.” Or
she may follow the graceful foreign custom and be
known as “Madame Brown,” which gives a pretty
touch of dignity and makes it easy for callers to
designate which of the two ladies they wish to see
if both are living in the same house.</p>

<p>A married woman never takes her husband’s title,
no matter what that may be. She is never “Mrs.
Judge ——” or “Mrs. Colonel ——.” Even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
president’s wife is simply “Mrs. Cleveland” or “Mrs.
Harrison.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">ADDRESSING THE PRESIDENT</div>

<p>In direct address, the president of the United
States is “Mr. President.” The vice-president is
“Mr. ——.” Members of the cabinet are “Secretary
A.” or “Secretary B.,” when introduced, and
are addressed as “Mr. Secretary.” Senators are
always addressed by their titles, but representatives
are “Mr.” Except in naval and military circles titles
expire with office. The man who was governor
or mayor last year should not be introduced as
“Ex-governor ——,” “Ex-mayor ——.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Perhaps there is no social obligation that is more
neglected and ignored than that of calling at proper
times and regular intervals. In the rush and hurry
of American life, it is well-nigh impossible for the
busy woman to perform her duty in this line unless
she have a certain degree of system about it. To
this end she should keep a regular calling-list or
book, and pay strict heed to the debit and credit
columns. It will require much management and
thought to arrange her visits so that they will always
fall on the “At Home” days of her acquaintances.
When a woman has an “At Home” day
it is an unwarrantable liberty for any one to call
at any other time unless it be on business, or by
special invitation, or permission. As many women<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
have the same day at home one must limit the
length of a call to fifteen or twenty minutes upon
a casual acquaintance, never making it longer than
half an hour even at the house of a friend.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">HOW TO SAY GOOD-BY</div>

<p>One should learn to take one’s departure on a
remark of one’s own, not hurrying away the moment
one’s friend ceases to talk. On the other hand
lingering good-bys in ordinary intercourse are a mistake
and suggest that one lacks the finesse necessary
to manage a polite withdrawal. An amusing
story was told in a recent magazine—and vouched
for as true—in which two young southern lads
making their first formal call, were driven <i>to stay
all night</i> because they could not get away—they
were so timid.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Some persons seem to feel that there is a certain
amount of pomp and circumstance about calling on
an “At Home” day, and the novice in society asks
timidly what she is to do at such a time. She is
to do simply what she would do on any other day
when she is sure of finding her hostess in and disengaged.
The caller hands her card to the servant
opening the door; then enters the parlor, greets her
hostess, who will probably introduce her to any
other guests who happen to be present, unless there
be a large number of these, in which case she will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
probably be introduced to a few in her immediate
vicinity. The caller will chat for a few minutes,
take a cup of tea, coffee or chocolate offered her,
with a biscuit, sandwich or piece of cake, or decline
all refreshment if she prefers. At the end of fifteen
or twenty minutes, she will rise, say “Good afternoon”
to her hostess, murmur a “Good afternoon”
to the company in general and take her departure.
If her card has not been taken by the servant who
opened the door for her, the caller may lay it on the
hall table as she goes out.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">REFRESHMENTS FOR CALLERS</div>

<p>When a woman is at home one day a week for
several months, she is expected to make very little
preparation in the way of refreshment for her
chance guests. The tea tray is ready on the tea-table
at one side of the room, and upon it are cups
and saucers, teapot, canister and hot-water kettle.
A plate of thin bread and butter, or sandwiches,
or biscuits, and another of sweet wafers or
fancy cakes, stand on this table. Sugar and cream
and sliced lemon complete the outfit. The kettle is
kept boiling that fresh tea may be made when required,
and a servant enters when needed to take
out the used cups. If there are many callers, the
services of this maid may be required to assist in
passing cups, and sugar and cream. Otherwise the
hostess may attend to such matters herself, chatting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
pleasantly as she does so. It is not incumbent on
a caller to take anything to eat or drink unless she
wishes to do this. When one attends half-a-dozen
such “At Homes” in an afternoon one would have
to carry a bag like that worn by Jack the Giant-Killer
of fairy lore, if one were to accept refreshments
at each house. The hostess should, therefore,
never insist that a guest eat and drink if she has
declined to do so.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">HOW MANY CARDS TO LEAVE</div>

<p>In calling on a married woman a matron leaves
one of her own cards and two of her husband’s.
Her card is for the hostess, one of her husband’s is
for the hostess and the other for the man of the
house. If there be several ladies in the family, as
for instance, a mother and two daughters, the caller
leaves one of her own and one of her husband’s
cards for each woman, and an extra card from
her husband for each man of the household.</p>

<p>This is the general rule, but it must have some
exceptions. For instance, in a household where
there are five or six women it is ridiculous to
leave an entire pack of visiting-cards. In this case
a woman leaves her card for “the ladies,” and
leaves it with her husband’s, also for “the ladies.”
One of his cards is also left for the man of the
family. Or if there be several men it may be left
simply for “the gentlemen.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>If one knows that there is a guest staying at
a house at which one calls, one must send in one’s
card for this guest. Or, if one have a friend staying
in the same town with one, and one calls on
her, it is a breach of good breeding not to inquire
for the friend’s hostess and leave a card for her
whether she appear or not.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When an engagement is made known the members
of the man’s family should immediately call
on his fiancée and her family, and a formal dinner
should be given for them within two weeks.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE BLACK-EDGED CARD</div>

<p>Custom clings to the black-edged card for those
in mourning. It has its uses and surely its abuses.
For those in deep mourning it is a convenience to
send in the form of regrets, as the black edge
gives sufficient reason in itself for the non-acceptance
of invitations. It may also be sent with gifts
to friends. If one uses it as a calling-card the
border should be very narrow. If one is in such
deep mourning that one’s card must appear with
a half-inch of black around it, one is certainly in
too deep mourning to pay calls. Until the black
edge can be reduced to the less ostentatious eighth-of-an-inch
width, the owner would do well to shun
society.</p>

<p>Nor should a black-edged card accompany an invitation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
to a social function. Several seasons ago
a matron introduced to society in a large city a
niece who had, eighteen months before, lost a
brother. With the hostess’ invitations to the reception
was enclosed the card of the young guest,
and this card had a black border an eighth of an
inch wide. The recipients of the invitations were
to be pardoned if they wondered a bit at the incongruity
of a person in mourning receiving at a
large party. Under the circumstances she should
have declined to have the social function given in
her honor, or should have laid aside her insignia
of dolor.</p>

<p>If, then, one has reached the point where one
is ready to reenter society, let one give up the
mourning-cards and again use plain white bits of
pasteboard.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">CALLING AFTER A DEATH</div>

<p>In calling at a house after a bereavement, it is
well, except when the afflicted one is an intimate
friend, to leave the card with a message of sympathy
at the door. One may, if one wishes, leave
flowers with the card. A fortnight after the funeral
one may call and ask to see the ladies of the
family, adding that if they do not feel like seeing
callers they will please not think of coming down.
Under such circumstances only a supersensitive person
will be hurt by receiving the message that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
ladies beg to be excused, and that they are grateful
for the kind thought that prompted the call.</p>

<p>The rule that we have just given applies to the
household in which there is serious illness. A call
may consist of an inquiry at the door, and leaving
a card. This may be accompanied by some such
message as, “Please express my sincere hope that
Mrs. Smith will soon be better, and assure Mr.
Smith that if I can be of any service to him, or
Mrs. Smith, I shall be grateful if he will let me
know.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">MAKING PARTY CALLS</div>

<p>One should always return a first call within three
weeks after it has been made. After a dinner,
luncheon or card-party, a call must be made within
a fortnight. An afternoon tea requires no “party
call.” After a large reception one may call within
the month. After a wedding reception one must
call within a fortnight on the mother of the bride,
and on the bride on her “At Home” day as soon
as possible after her return from the wedding trip.
If one is in doubt as to the propriety of calling
after an invitation, it is better to err on the side
of making the call. One’s courteous intention will
surely be appreciated while not to call may seem
an unpardonable omission.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the case of an invitation extended without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
a first call having been made, women sometimes
express doubt as to the course they should pursue.
In the first place they will do well to realize
that some of the people who entertain most delightfully
are extremely busy people to whom the
rigid routine of formal etiquette would be an intolerable
burden. A clever woman is known by
nothing more certainly than by the unerring instinct
with which she relaxes her demands in such instances.
If the woman who wishes to entertain
encloses her own card this may be accepted as a
substitute for the usual first call. The social value
of one dinner invitation transcends many calls.
Even if the visiting-card is not enclosed the recipient
of the invitation will—if she be a sensible
woman—accept if she really wishes to do so. At
this point, however, social usage should begin to
assert itself and the invited one should not fail to
make the customary call of appreciation after the
“party.” If one does not wish to make the acquaintance
offered a formal note of declination will
serve to discourage further intrusion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">EXCEPTIONS TO SOCIAL RULES</div>

<p>A rather surprising question sometimes asked is
whether one should call after a dinner or dance
invitation that has been declined. Certainly, the
call should be made. One has been honored by
one’s friends and the fact that one was prevented
by circumstances from actually enjoying their hospitality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
makes no difference whatever with one’s
responsibility for expressing appreciation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A card with a message written on it fills many
convenient social needs but it should never be used
to take the place of a formal note. So employed
it suggests haste and a degree of indifference that
are contrary to the best breeding. The corners of
cards are no longer turned down for any purpose.</p>

<p>If one, on calling, is told by the servant opening
the door that “Mrs. Brown is not at home,” this
does not mean literally that Mrs. Brown is of necessity
out of the house, neither does it mean that
the servant has been instructed to tell an untruth.
“Not at home” is an accepted abbreviation for “Not
at home to visitors.” There are those to whom
the phrase will, however, always have a disagreeable
ring, and if Mrs. Brown have more tact and
originality than the conventions demand she will
probably direct her maid to say instead, “Mrs.
Brown is not receiving to-day. She receives on
Mondays.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">WHO SHOULD CALL FIRST</div>

<p>Who calls first? The custom of residents calling
on the newcomer is so firmly established in almost
all communities that one may wonder at the question
being asked. Yet in Washington—that is to
say, in official Washington, this custom is reversed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
and it is the newcomer who calls at the White
House, on the vice-president, members of the cabinet,
etc. In the case of the highest officials a return
call is not expected but the courtesy is recognized
by an invitation to some general reception.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CUSTOM IN SMALL TOWNS</div>

<p>The hours for calling vary according to the community
one is in—though no afternoon call should
be made before three o’clock. In small towns and
villages where supper is eaten at six o’clock, one
should not prolong a call after five-thirty. Evening
calls in most American cities are usually made
at eight o’clock or soon after, though in large
eastern places where dinner is not served until seven,
seven-thirty or eight, the nine o’clock call is not
unusual.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Calls on the sick should be made with the greatest
discretion. One should ascertain in the first
place whether or not one’s friend will really be
equal to seeing one, and then stay for a few moments
only. Sick-bed visits especially should not
be allowed to become visitations. Many a person
with a chance for recovery has literally been talked
into his grave by well-meaning callers. Intelligent
nurses will quietly ask such people to remain away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>LETTER-WRITING</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE writing of letters, of the good old-fashioned
kind, is rapidly becoming a thing of
the past. People used to write epistles. Now they
write notes. Before the days of the stenographer,
the typewriter, the telegraph and telephone, when
people made their own clothes by hand, wove their
own sheets and had no time-saving machines, they
found leisure to write epistles to their friends.
Some of us are so fortunate as to have stowed
away in an old trunk a bundle of these productions.
The ink is pale and the paper yellowed,
but the matter is still interesting. All the news
of the family, the neighborhood gossip, the latest
sayings and doings of the children and of callers,
an account of the books read, of the minister’s
last sermon and of the arrival of the newest of
many olive branches, filled pages. What must these
same pages have meant to the exile from home!
And how much there was in such letters to answer!</p>

<p>Still, even in this day and generation, there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
a few people who have so far held to the good
old traditions that they write genuine letters. And—wonder
of wonders!—they answer questions
asked them in letters written by their correspondents.
Only those who have written questions to
which they desired prompt answers, appreciate how
maddening it is to receive a letter that tells you
everything except the answers to your queries.
And this ignoring of the epistle one is supposed
to be answering is a feature of the up-to-date letter-writer.
There is, even in friendly correspondence,
a right and a wrong way of doing a thing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOW NOT TO WRITE</div>

<p>The wrong, and well-nigh universal, way of
treating a letter is as follows: It is read as rapidly
as possible, pigeonholed and forgot. Weeks
hence, in clearing out the desk it is found, the
handwriting recognized, and it is laid aside to be
answered later. When that “later” comes depends
on the leisure of the owner. At last a so-called
answer is hastily written without a second reading
of the letter to which one is replying. Such a
reply begins with an apology for a long and unavoidable
silence, an account of how cruelly busy
one is nowadays, a passing mention of the number
of duties one has to perform, a wish that the two
correspondents may meet in the near future and
a rushing final sentence of affection followed by
the signature. Such is the modern letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>If a correspondent is worth having, she is
worth treating fairly. Let her letter be read carefully,
and laid aside until such time as one can
have a half-hour of uninterrupted writing. Then,
let the letter one would answer be read, and the
questions it contains be answered in order, and first
of all. This is common courtesy. After which
one may write as much as time and inclination permit.
If one has not the time to conduct one’s
correspondence in this way, let one have fewer
correspondents. It is more fair to them and to
one’s self.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE GOOD-LOOKING NOTE</div>

<p>Colored letter-paper is in bad form unless the
color be a pale gray or a light blue. From time to
time, stationers have put upon the market paper
outré in design and coloring, and the persons who
have used it were just what might be expected. It
reminds one of what Richard Grant White said
of the words “gents” and “pants”—he noticed “that
the one generally wore the other.” So, paper that
is such bad form as this is usually used by persons
who are “bad form.” All good-looking notes
have a considerable margin at the left hand; punctilious
people insist on a right-hand margin also.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SEALING THE ENVELOPE</div>

<p>Plain white or cream paper of good quality is
always in fashion. For social correspondence this
paper must be so cut that it is folded but once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
to be slipped into an envelope. At the top of the
page in the middle may be the address, as “123
West Barrows Street,” and the name of the city.
Just now, this is the only marking that is used on
the sheet, although some persons have the initials
or monogram, or crest, in place of the address.
It is no longer fashionable to have the crest or
monogram and the address also. The envelope is
marked or not, as one chooses. The use of sealing-wax
gives a touch of distinction for which a few
persons still take time. Only white or delicately
colored wax is acceptable, unless at holiday time,
when the festive touch given by scarlet is in season.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Letter-heads, such as are used for business correspondence,
should never be used for social purposes.
Even the business man may keep in his
office desk a quire or two of plain paper upon
which to write society notes and replies to invitations.
Nor is it permissible for him to use the
typewriter in inditing these. All his business correspondence
may be conducted with the aid of the
invaluable machine, and he may, if he ask permission
to do so, send letters to members of his
own family on the typewriter. But all other correspondence
should be done with pen and ink.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Unfortunately, mourning stationery is still in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
vogue. The recipient of a black-edged letter is
often conscious of a distinct shock when she first
sees the emblem of dolor, and wonders if it contains
the notice of a death. For this reason many
considerate followers of conventionalities do not use
the black-edged stationery, but content themselves
with plain white paper marked with the address
or monogram in black lettering.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A social or friendly letter is frequently dated at
the end, at the left-hand lower corner of the signature.
A business communication is dated at the
upper right-hand corner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ADDRESSING BUSINESS FIRMS</div>

<p>The expression “My dear Mr. Blank” is more
formal than is “Dear Mr. Blank,” and is, therefore,
used in society notes. Do not—as some have done—begin
“dear” with a capital. Unsophisticated
persons sometimes hesitate to use the prefix “dear,”—they
may be assured that in this connection it
is merely a polite form, with no sentimental flavor
whatever. Business letters addressed to a man
should begin with the name of the person to whom
they are intended on one line, the salutation on
the next, as: “Mr. John Smith” on the upper line,
and below this, “Dear Sir.” In addressing a firm
consisting of more than one person, write the name
of the firm, as “Smith, Jones and Company,” then
below, “Dear Sirs.” The salutation “Gentlemen”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
in such a case is old-fashioned but is preferred by
some ceremonious persons who also like to put
“Esq.” after a man’s name on an envelope in place
of putting “Mr.” before it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE SIGNATURE</div>

<p>It should be unnecessary to remind women not
to preface their signatures with the title “Mrs.”
or “Miss.” Such a mistake stamps one as a vulgarian
or an ignoramus. The name in full may
be signed, as: “Mary Bacon Smith.” If the writer
be a married woman, and the person to whom she
writes does not know whether she be married or
single, she should write her husband’s name with
the preface “Mrs.” below her signature, or in the
lower left-hand corner of the sheet, as (“Mrs.
James Hayes Smith”). An unmarried woman will
save her correspondent embarrassment by putting
“Miss Brown” in parentheses in this corner.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>To sign one’s name prefaced by the first letter is
no longer considered good form. “J. Henry Wells”
should be “John Henry Wells.” If one would use
one initial letter instead of the full name, let that
letter be the middle initial, as “John H. Wells,” or
“J. H. Wells.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE POSTAL CARD</div>

<p>I wish I could impress on all followers of good
form that a postal card is a solecism except when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
used for business purposes. If it is an absolute
necessity to send one to a friend or a member of
one’s family, as, when stopping for a moment at
a railroad station one wishes to send a line home
telling of one’s safety at the present stage of the
journey, the sentences should be short and to the
point, and unprefaced by an affectionate salutation.
All love-messages should be omitted, as should the
intimate termination that is entirely proper in a
sealed letter. “Affectionately” or “Lovingly” are
out of place when written upon a postal card. Expressions
such as “God bless you!” or “I love you,”
or “Love to the dear ones,” are in shockingly bad
taste except under cover of an envelope. A good
rule to impress on those having a penchant for
the prevalent post-card is as follows: “Use for
business when brevity and simplicity are the order
of the day; never use for friendly correspondence
unless the purchase of a sheet of paper, envelope
and postage stamp is an impossibility.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The friendly letter may be as long as time and
inclination permit. The business communication
should be written in as few and clear sentences as
possible. Some one has said that to write a model
business letter one should “begin in the middle of
it.” In other words, it should be unprefaced by
any unnecessary sentences, but should begin immediately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
on the business in hand, continue and
finish with it. For such letters “Very truly yours”
is the correct ending, unless, as in the case of a
man or firm addressing a letter to a person totally
unknown to the writer, and of marked eminence,
when the expression “Respectfully yours” may be
used.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">LETTERS OF CONDOLENCE</div>

<p>Many people consider letters of congratulation
and condolence the most difficult to write. This
is because one feels that a certain kind of form is
necessary and that conventional and stilted phrases
are proper under the circumstances. This is a mistake,
for, going on the almost unfailing principle
that what comes from the heart, goes to the heart,
the best form to be used toward those in sorrow
or joy is a genuine expression of feeling. If you
are sorry for a friend, write to her that you are,
and that you are thinking of her and longing to
help her. If you are happy in her happiness, say
so as cordially as words can express it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It happens now and then that even the quietest
person wishes to write to a man of political prominence.
Such persons, whether they be diplomats
or members of Congress, may properly be addressed
as “Honorable Mr. ——.” The president is “The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
Honorable, the President of the United States.”
To use the article before the title is more elegant.
Bishops of any church are entitled to the prefix,
“The Right Reverend.” In conversation, the rector
of a “high” Episcopal church is often affectionately
addressed as “Father ——,” but this form of
greeting would not be used on an envelope. The
dean of a cathedral should be addressed as “The
Very Reverend ——.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Very small paper and envelopes for society notes
are less used than formerly, many persons preferring
what are called correspondence cards, heavy
cream-white single cards on which a few lines may
be written and which are slipped into their envelopes
without folding.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">LETTERS OF INTRODUCTION</div>

<p>Letters of introduction should bear on the outside
of the envelope, in the lower left-hand corner
the words, “Introducing Miss ——,” in order that
the two thus brought together may be saved any
momentary embarrassment. They should not be
sealed. One should be very careful not to give
these letters unless one is reasonably warranted
in making a demand on the time and courtesy of
the person on whom one is making the social draft.
To give one’s card by way of introduction makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
less of a demand on one’s friend than does a letter.
A woman does not present a letter of introduction
in person; a man does.</p>

<p>When one avails one’s self of a member of one’s
family or a friend as messenger, one should write
on the envelope in the lower left-hand corner,
“Kindness of Mary” or “Politeness of Miss
Briggs.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">ENCLOSING A STAMP</div>

<p>We can not close this chapter on letter-writing
without a word to the person who writes a letter
asking a question on his own business, and fails
to enclose a stamp. This is equivalent to asking
the recipient on whom one has no claim to give
one the time required for writing an answer to
one’s query, and a two-cent stamp as well. When
the matter on which one writes is essentially one’s
own business, and not that of the person to whom
one writes and from whom one demands a reply,
one should always enclose a stamp, thus making
the favor one asks of the least possible trouble to
one’s correspondent. Some people enclose a stamped
and self-addressed envelope but as the other person’s
paper may not fit the envelope, the well-meant
courtesy often defeats itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROMPTNESS IN ANSWERING</div>

<p>In all business and society correspondence a letter
should be answered as soon as possible after
it is received. One may afford to take a certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
amount of liberty with one’s friends, and lay aside
a letter for some days before answering it. But
the acceptance or declinature of an invitation, and
the answer to a business communication, should
be sent with as little delay as possible.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>INTRODUCTIONS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THIS matter of introductions is one rather too
lightly considered on our free American soil.
Unless the social exigencies are such as to make
the atmosphere formal and unpleasant if people are
unknown to each other, it is taking a liberty to
present a man to a woman without first and privately
asking her permission. It is a woman’s privilege
to decline or to accept masculine acquaintance
as she chooses. If she grants permission for the
introduction, the person who has asked such permission
brings the man in question to her and
says: “Miss A., may I have the pleasure of presenting
Mr. B. to you?” We have all been witnesses
at some time or other of that most unconventional
performance where the woman in the case
allows herself to be dragged across the floor to
the man concerned. We have all, on occasion,
heard the proper form so twisted as to make the
woman the person presented instead of the man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
This is the worst sort of no-form. The social convention
prescribes that the man shall take the initiative
in requesting the introduction, that he shall
seek the lady, that he shall be the person presented.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INTRODUCING ONE’S HUSBAND</div>

<p>An American woman in presenting her husband
will usually say, “My husband, Mr. Smith.” An
English woman would be more formal. She would
say simply, “Mr. Smith.” When a man is presented
to a woman, if she is seated she need not
rise but may merely bow. In case the man is distinguished
or elderly or if he be a warm friend of
her husband, or her guest, she will rise and shake
hands.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Never awkwardly drag a newcomer around to
every person in a large circle. Introduce him to
several of those nearest and later such further introductions
as are desirable will naturally follow.
When the group includes a half-dozen only, it
is necessary to introduce all round. In this case
the ceremony may be gracefully shortened by repeating
two or three names together, thus: “Mrs.
Brown, Mrs. Smith, may I present Mr. James?”</p>

<p>Never introduce your sister or your daughter,
if she be grown, merely as such. The other person
will be confused, not knowing whether the one
introduced is married or single, and hence in doubt
as to what name to use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">CLERICAL INTRODUCTIONS</div>

<p>At a reception given to an archbishop of the
Roman Catholic church, it is customary for devout
Catholics to kiss the ring but Protestants may
merely shake hands. A cardinal ranks as a prince
of the Roman Catholic church and is addressed as
“His Eminence.” Women as well as men are presented
to him, not he to them. A woman is also
presented to a bishop.</p>

<p>When two women of about equal age and importance
are to be introduced merely mention the
two names, thus: “Mrs. A., Mrs. B.” The general
rule in all introductions is to present the woman
to the man, the young man or young woman to
the elderly, the unmarried woman to the matron,
when of about the same age. One may say “May
I present” or with two men of near the same age,
“I want you to know.” Never say, “Let me make
you acquainted with.” That is provincial.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">ADDRESSING THE QUEEN</div>

<p>The American who goes abroad expecting to be
presented at court must, of course, acquaint himself
with the etiquette of that court. He will receive
such advice as he needs from his ambassador
but it may be useful for him to know ahead of
time some of the things that are required of him,
or more precisely of her, for court presentations
are much more coveted and sought after by American
women than by men. However, it is understood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
that a man whose wife has been presented is himself
eligible to attend the king’s next reception for
gentlemen only. The English queen is addressed
simply as “Ma’am” by all Americans who have
the honor of presentation. King George would
be addressed as “Sir.” The Prince of Wales is
“Prince” and his wife “Princess.” The phrase
“Your Majesty” is reserved for use by the lower
English classes. An American, by virtue of his
having no rank at all, takes rank with the highest
when he is introduced at court. A duke is addressed
simply as “Duke,” and a marquis by his
title, “Lord ——.” The daughters of dukes, marquises
and earls must be given their Christian names,
as “Lady Mary Towers.” The sons should be addressed
as “Lord John Towers,” “Lord Henry
Towers.” An archbishop is properly addressed as
“Your Grace” or “My Lord,” but his wife is plain
“Mrs. ——.” Members of foreign royal families
have the title of “Prince” and “Princess.”</p>

<p>A baron visiting in this country would be presented
to the American ladies he meets quite like any
other gentleman, and his wife would not take precedence
of them unless she happened to be elderly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When in a friend’s house one should bear in
mind that introductions are the natural prerogative
of the host and the hostess. One should not,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
however, allow an awkward situation to develop
from a too rigid observance of this rule.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PROFESSIONAL MEN</div>

<p>Remember that many professional men do not
like to be called “Professor” because of the cheap
ways in which this title has in recent years been
used. By a little tact in individual instances one
can learn which is preferred—“Professor,” or
“Mr.,” or “Doctor,” if the person in question be
entitled to that distinction.</p>

<p>In making introductions a clever man or woman
often adds a word of comment that will help the
two meeting to start their acquaintance on a friendly
and intelligent basis.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>AFTER SIX O’CLOCK</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">FOR most of us the active business of the day
is over at sundown. Mothers of large families,
physicians and occasionally other workers are
employed over time; but most of us can count on
leisure after six o’clock. Much of our happiness
depends upon how this leisure is employed. That
it should afford recreation of one sort or another
is a commonly accepted opinion, though one that
is accepted usually without appreciation of the obligations
involved. Recreation implies something
more than idleness. One can not be amused in any
worth-while sense without sitting up and paying
attention. Foreigners complain habitually that
Americans take their pleasure sadly, that they do
not go in for gaiety with spirit. We are much
more vital in our attitude toward work than toward
play. We know that we must pay for success
in labor of any sort, but the debt we owe to
amusement is a point not yet so widely grasped.
Pleasure is shy of the person who makes only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
occasional advances to her. She must be courted
habitually in order to give a full return. We
are all acquainted with the dull unhappy appearance
of the sedulous man of business off for a
rare holiday. He is out of his element. He knows
how to behave himself at work but he is not acquainted
with the fundamental principles of having
a good time. These can not be learned in a minute.
One must have practise in enjoyment in order
to carry off the matter easily; and this practise
should be a habit of every-day life. Many people
who stand shyly off from the delights of the world
and wonder why they are deprived of them, fail
to realize that diversion of any sort worthy the
name, is a thing for which one must make some
effort.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">HOME FESTIVITY</div>

<p>It is at home that one should cultivate the graces
that make one attractive abroad; and this is only
preliminary to saying that planning for the every-day
recreation of a household should be as much
a matter of course as devising ways and means
for the purchase of food and clothing.</p>

<p>The first requisite for bringing about an atmosphere
of festivity and good cheer at home is to
adopt in some degree the methods that one uses
away from home. If one is invited out to dinner,
one makes some preparation for it, and so one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
should do for dinner at home. Externals have much
to do with coaxing gaiety to live as a guest in the
house. A pretty table and food managed with some
regard to esthetic values as well as to the palatable
quality, have a happy effect upon the mind and
temper of the diners. A few flowers properly distributed
assist still further. If all the inmates of
a house are in the habit, as they should be, of
making some change in their toilet for dinner, this
of itself makes a sharp line of demarcation between
the work-time and the play-time of the twenty-four
hours. The hint of festivity in attire induces a happy
and a festive frame of mind, imparts just that
touch of difference from the habit of prosaic daylight
necessary to send the mind sailing off into
pleasant channels.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE HOME DINNER</div>

<p>The care for the dinner-table, for the personal appearance
and, generally speaking, for pretty environment
implies effort. Lazy people can not hope
for these delightful effects of a material kind.
Neither can they expect the happiness which comes
to those who take some pains at home for the mental
entertainment of themselves and their household.
There are many people who regard it as deceitful
and insincere to forecast what one shall talk about
and it is quite true that <i>formally</i> planned talk is a
foe to spontaneity and naturalness. But usually the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
man or woman who entertains by his conversation
is the person who, in a general way, has taken some
thought about what he shall say. Given the opportunity,
conversation, charming in its spontaneity,
rises out of the mental habit of noting down for future
reference pleasant or odd personal experiences,
good stories, the quirks in one’s own mind. One
must not intrude these in a place where they do not
fit, but it is not in the least a social sin to guide the
talk toward your own thought provided you do not
thereby push out something better. We are all given
tongues and with them a certain conversational
responsibility. If each member of the family made
it his business and his pleasure during the day to
remember the best part of his experience that he
might relate it at the dinner-hour some part of that
gloom which descends upon so many American families
at the evening meal would be dissipated.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE TIME FOR PLAY</div>

<p>If one cultivates the prettier touches of personal
appearance for that part of the day after six o’clock,
whether at home or abroad, one should also cultivate
the pleasanter and more agreeable states of
mind. Business should be put behind one. The
petty cares of the day should go unmentioned. The
ills of body and mind should be, as far as possible,
forgot. Those little courtesies and formalities
of manner that we admire in the practised man or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
woman of society are as decorative at home as
away and equally creative of a festive atmosphere.
In one of the magazines of the last decade there is
a homely effective story of a young girl, just home
from a house-party and full of its gaiety, to whom
the idea occurred that the methods employed by
her hostess might make a delightful week in her own
large family circle. She took the matter in hand,
and invited her mother to be the guest of honor for
the seven days. Some entertainment was planned
for each evening in the week, sometimes with visitors
and sometimes not. The women of the family
wore their best frocks frequently during the
week. The prettiest china and the best silver were
used as freely as if for company. The result of it
all was that the family voted visiting at home a
signal success.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">GAMES AS A PASTIME</div>

<p>There are many specific ways of providing
amusement for evenings at home. One has space
only for the mention of a few of these in a short
article on the subject. Games of various kinds are
an excellent resource for making the after-dinner
time pass pleasantly. They cultivate quickness of
decision, sociability, a friendly rivalry. Success in
games is partly a matter of chance but much more of
attention and skill. Many people sniff at them who
are too lazy to make the conquest of their methods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Charades, of which English people never grow
tired, as a means of diversion, have their ups and
downs in the more quickly changing fashions of
America. They provide one of the easiest and
merriest means of entertainment. They may be
of any degree of simplicity or elaboration, and they
call forth as much or as little ingenuity as is possessed
by the actors in any given case. They are
usually popular because almost everybody has latent
a little talent for the actor’s art at which he is
willing to try his luck. Many people who are
afraid to join in formal theatricals find an outlet
for this taste in charades; and so informal usually
is this kind of entertainment that the spectators
enjoy the acting whether well done or otherwise.
It is enough to see one’s friends and acquaintances
struggling with a part. If well done, one enjoys
the success; if not, one applauds the absurdity of
the conception.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">READING ALOUD</div>

<p>Reading aloud to a congenial home party has
much to be said in its favor, in spite of its present
reputation as a stupid means of passing an evening.
“The world may be divided into two classes,” runs
an old and favorably known joke, “those who like
reading aloud and those who do not. Those who
like it are those who do the reading; those who dislike
it are those who do the listening.” The half-truth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
in this witticism must not be accepted for
more than it is worth. As an occasional means of
passing an evening, reading aloud is diverting and
stimulating. The habit of spending one’s evenings
in that way is not an encouragement to variety and
liveliness of mind. One gets into the way of depending
upon the author in hand for entertainment
instead of depending upon the action of one’s own
mind. Small doses of reading aloud are good.
Continual doses are fatal to a proper social ideal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE POPULAR HOUSE</div>

<p>The people who make their own houses a center
of attraction are, generally speaking, happy people.
The house where the evening is accepted as a time
of diversion is the popular house. The atmosphere
there begets gaiety and naturalness of manner. We
have all had the experience of making evening calls
where we were compelled to stand in the hall till
the gas was lighted in the drawing-room or the
electricity turned on, where we must pass a dreary
fifteen minutes before the members of the family
are ready to receive. This kind of preliminary puts
a damper upon the spirits of host and guests from
which they do not easily recover. To be ready for
pleasant evenings, to meet them half-way by one’s
attitude is a good recipe for insuring their arrival.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE SUNDAY NIGHT SUPPER</div>

<p>A pleasant and informal method of insuring good
times in one’s own house is to make a feature of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
Sunday night supper. This is not so formal or
expensive a mode of entertainment as dinner-giving.
It is a jolly and pleasant method. One may
have everything in the way of edibles prepared for
the meal in the morning except perhaps one article
to be made on the chafing-dish. One may serve
this meal with or without servants. Often the
guests enjoy the freedom implied in helping the
hostess carry off successfully the details of serving.
The Sunday evening supper is one of those festivities
that imply some elasticity in numbers. This
is the sort of meal to which the unexpected guest is
welcome, at which the person who “happens in”
may feel entirely at ease. Where there are young
people in the house, the Sunday night supper is an
especially popular institution. They appreciate the
delights of entertaining without the care or the formality
of more elaborate functions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRACTISING COURTESY</div>

<p>The ways of enjoying life away from home after
six o’clock in the evening, readily suggest themselves.
There are the various functions to which
one is invited. There is the theater, the most delightful
of resources, but unfortunately one which
by reason of its expense is available frequently only
by the rich. Receptions, dinners, card-parties and
the theater all go to make this earth a more agreeable
place to those who have the social instinct. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
it must never be forgot that the fundamental
place for the cultivation of this instinct is at home,
which is the practise ground for formal and general
society.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>FUNCTIONS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE rules that apply to a dinner hold good at
a luncheon, to which function ladies only are
usually invited, although when served at twelve
o’clock, and called “breakfast,” men are also bidden.</p>

<p>At a luncheon the women leave their coats in the
dressing-room, wearing their hats and gloves to the
table. The gloves are drawn off as soon as all are
seated. Just why women elect to sit through an
entire meal in a private house with their hats on is
not readily explained and some independent hostesses
request that hats be removed. But if they are
retained, the gloves also should be worn to the table,
not taken off up-stairs, as is often done. When the
gloves are long, some women merely pull off the
lower part and tuck it into the wrist, an ugly habit.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In giving luncheons, hostesses with beautifully
polished tables often prefer to use doilies of linen
or lace instead of a cloth. More precise women
never serve a meal without using a table-cloth, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
from an artistic point of view the shining surface
of bare mahogany is charming.</p>

<p>Luncheon guests should remember that their hostess
may have engagements for the late afternoon,
and not ordinarily prolong their stay after three
o’clock—if luncheon has been at one.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">FORMAL RECEPTIONS</div>

<p>At an evening reception, the guests ascend to the
dressing-rooms, if they wish, or may leave wraps
in the hall, if a servant be there to take them. When
one comes in a carriage with only an opera wrap
over a reception gown, it is hardly worth while to
mount the stairs. But this must be decided by the
arrangements made by the entertainers. Before one
enters the drawing-room one deposits one’s cards on
the salver on the hall table. If there be a servant
announcing guests the new arrival gives his name
clearly and distinctly to this functionary, who repeats
it in such a tone that those receiving may hear
it. The guest enters the parlors at this moment,
proceeds directly to his hostess, and after greeting
her, speaks with each person receiving with her.
He then passes on and mingles with the rest of the
company.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An afternoon reception is conducted in the same
manner, the only difference being that, at an evening
function refreshments are more elaborate than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
at an afternoon affair, and frequently the guests
repair to the dining-room, if this be large. At some
day receptions, this is also done, but at a tea refreshments
are usually passed in the drawing-rooms. A
friend of the hostess usually pours the tea and the
chocolate, and other friends are asked to assist. At
successful receptions these ladies do not seek their
especial friends among the guests, but are rather
on the lookout for any who may be strange or
timid.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CORRECT AFTERNOON DRESS</div>

<p>Refreshments so elaborate that they will spoil
the appetite for dinner are not to be served at afternoon
affairs. At the tea proper, only tea, bread
and butter and little cakes are offered. If more
than this is served the occasion is more properly
called a reception. In any case the entertainment
given in the afternoon should not take on the elaborate
nature of an evening party and only in provincial
communities is it allowed to do this. Many
women in such places do not properly distinguish
between afternoon and evening dress. While a
woman may suitably wear before six a gown
slightly low in the neck, she should not until after
that hour wear one that is lower or whose sleeves
do not come to the elbow.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The “high tea” is a sit-down affair, really a very
late luncheon. It is said to have originated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Philadelphia and is, as one would expect, a formal
stately affair with an elaborate menu. The
guests have a delightful time—but do not want any
dinner that evening.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HOW TO REVIVE FLOWERS</div>

<p>It is useful to know that when on the afternoon
of a reception or dinner flowers intended for decoration
arrive from the florist in a wilted condition
they may often be revived by plunging the stems
in boiling water.</p>

<p>At a very large reception it is not now required
that one force one’s self on the attention of the
hostess for the sake of taking formal leave. One
may instead depart whenever one is ready to do so.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Music at a reception should not be so loud as
to make talking difficult. In any but the largest
houses a harp stationed in a side room or hall
is ample. Foreigners find our babel of voices at
such affairs subjects of criticism but often indeed
one must shout if one is to be heard. Oliver
Wendell Holmes is said to have described the average
afternoon tea in four words, thus: “Gibble,
gabble, gobble, git.” It can not be denied that they
often merit the satire.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE COMING-OUT PARTY</div>

<p>The “coming-out” party or reception, at which
the débutante makes her entrance in the world of
society, is conducted as is any other reception, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the débutante stands by her mother and receives
with her. Each guest speaks some pleasant word
of congratulation on shaking hands with the girl.
Her dress should be exquisite, and she should carry
flowers. These flowers are usually sent to her.
When more are received than she can carry, they
are placed about the room. If the coming-out party
be in the evening, it is often followed by a dance
for the young people.</p>

<p>In sending out invitations for such an affair, the
daughter’s card is enclosed with that of the mother,
or her name is engraved below that of her mother
on the latter’s card.</p>

<p>One may leave such a function as has just been
described as soon as one likes, and may take refreshments
or not as one wishes. Just before departing
the guest says good night to his hosts.</p>

<p>The hour at which one goes to a reception may
be at any time between the hours named on the
cards issued. One should never go too early, or,
if it can be avoided, on the stroke of the first hour
mentioned. If the cards read “eight-thirty to eleven
o’clock,” any time after nine o’clock will be proper
and one will then be pretty sure not to be the first
arrival of the company.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A card-party is a function at which one should
arrive with reasonable promptness. If the invitations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
call for eight-thirty, one must try not to be
more than ten or fifteen minutes late, as the starting
of the game will be thus delayed and the hostess
inconvenienced. After the game is ended, refreshments
are served, and as soon after that as one
pleases one may take one’s departure.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SERENITY AT CARDS</div>

<p>It is surprising how many people, at other times
well-bred, quite lose their tempers at bridge or
whist. The scent of a prize seems to arouse in
them a spirit of vulgarity one would not discredit
them with possessing if one met them away from
the card table. The only proper attitude in all
games is one or serenity and courtesy no matter
what unspeakable blunders your partner may commit.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The same rule of promptness applies to a musicale.
After greeting the hostess, guests take the
seats assigned to them, and chat with those persons
near them until the program is begun. During
the music not a word should be spoken. If one
has no love for music, let consideration for others
cause one to be silent. If this is impossible, it
is less unkind to send a regret than to attend and
by so doing mar others’ enjoyment of a musical
feast.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At a ball or large dance, one may arrive when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
one wishes. The ladies are shown to the dressing-room,
then meet their escorts at the head of the
stairs and descend to the drawing-rooms or dance-hall.
Here the host and hostess greet one, after
which one mingles with the company.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FILLING DANCE PROGRAMS</div>

<p>At a formal dance, programs or orders of dance
are provided, each man and each woman receiving
one as he or she leaves the dressing-room or enters
the drawing-room. Upon this card a woman has
inscribed the names of the various men who ask
for dances. As each man approaches her with the
request that he be given a dance, she hands him
her card and he writes his name on it, then writes
her name on the corresponding blank on his own
card. As he returns her program to her the man
should say “Thank you!” The woman may bow
slightly and smile or repeat the same words.</p>

<p>No woman versed in the ways of polite society
will give a dance promised to one man to another,
unless the first man be so crassly ignorant or careless
as to neglect to come for it. Should a man
be guilty of this rudeness he can only humbly
apologize and explain his mistake, begging to be
taken again into favor. If he be sincere the woman
must, by the laws of good breeding, consent to
overlook his lapse, but she need not give him the
next dance he asks for unless she believes him to
be excusable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>A man invited to a dance will properly pay particular
attention to the young ladies of the family
whose guest he is, and will not neglect to ask their
mother for one number if she be dancing. A convenient
phrase covering any doubt as to whether
a girl or woman wishes to take active part in
the festivities is, “Are you dancing to-night?”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HOSTESS AT A DANCE</div>

<p>The hostess at a dance must deny herself all
dancing, unless her guests are provided with partners—or,
at least, she should not dance during the
first part of the evening if other women are unsupplied
with partners. At a large ball the hostess
frequently has a floor committee of her men friends
to see that sets are formed and that partners are
provided for comparative strangers. No hirelings
will do this so skilfully or with so much tact as
will the personal friends of the entertainers.</p>

<p>A young girl may, after a dance, ask to be taken
to her chaperon, or to some other friend. She
should, soon after the dance given to one man,
dismiss him pleasantly, that he may ascertain the
whereabouts of his next partner before the beginning
of the next dance.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At a small house dance or other informal party
the hostess sometimes provides for the proper attendance
for the girls going home but it is not
often wise to depend on this. A girl, if she is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
going to the home of an intimate friend, need not
have a chaperon, but she should arrange that some
one call for her and thus relieve her hostess of
what is sometimes a trying responsibility. If the
guest be a mature woman she may enjoy absolute
independence by taking a cab.</p>

<p>The etiquette governing weddings and wedding
receptions will be explained in the chapters on
“Weddings.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE ENGAGED COUPLE</div>

<p>In our foremothers’ day the publicity of the declared
engagement was a thing unknown. Now,
the behavior of the affianced pair and what is due
to them from society deserve a page of their own.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most ill-at-ease couple are the newly-married,
but the engaged couple presses them hard
in this line. To behave well under the trying conditions
attendant upon a recently-announced engagement
demands tact and unselfishness. It should
not be necessary to remind any well-bred girl or
man that public exhibitions of affection are vulgar,
or that self-absorption, or absorption in each other,
is in wretched taste. The girl should act toward
her betrothed in company as if he were her brother
or any trusted man friend, avoiding all low-voiced
or seemingly confidential conversation. The man,
while attentive to every want and wish of the
woman he loves, must still mingle with others and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
talk with them, forcing himself, if necessary, to
recollect that there are other women in the world
besides the one of his choice. The fact that romantic
young people and critical older ones are
watching the behavior of the newly-engaged pair
and commenting mentally thereon, is naturally a
source of embarrassment to those most nearly concerned
in the matter. But let each remember that
people are becoming engaged each hour, that no
strange outward transformation has come over
them, and that all evidences of the marvelous
change which each may feel has transformed life
for him or her may be shown when they are in
private. If they love each other, their happiness
is too sacred a thing to be dragged forth for public
view.</p>

<p>It is customary, when an engagement is announced,
for the friends of the happy girl to send
her flowers, or some dainty betrothal gift. She
must acknowledge each of these by a note of thanks
and appreciation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">ANNOUNCING ENGAGEMENTS</div>

<p>It is not good form for a girl to announce her
own engagement, except to her own family and
dear friends. A friend of the family may do this,
either at a luncheon or party given for this purpose,
or by mentioning it to the persons who will
be interested in the pleasant news. When a girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
is congratulated, she should smile frankly and say
“Thank you!” She should drill herself not to appear
uncomfortably embarrassed. The same rule
applies to the happy man.</p>

<p>The conventional diamond solitaire ring is not
worn until the engagement is announced.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">WEDDING ANNIVERSARIES</div>

<p>The happily married often consider the Great
Event of their lives of sufficient interest to the
world-at-large to be commemorated by yearly festivities.</p>

<p>Cards for wedding anniversaries bear the names
of the married pair, the hours of the reception to
be given and the two dates, thus:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>June 15, 1880——June 15, 1905.</i><br />
</p>

<p>If the anniversary be the Silver Wedding the
script may be in silver; if a Golden Wedding, in
gilt. Wooden Wedding invitations, engraved or
written on paper in close imitation of birch bark, are
pretty. At one such affair all decorations were of
shavings, and the refreshments were served on
wooden plates. The Wooden Wedding is celebrated
after an interval of five years. At a Tin Wedding,
tinware was used extensively, even the punch being
taken from small tin cups and dippers. This wedding
marks the flight of ten years of married life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>The reception is usually held in the evening, and
husband and wife receive together, and, if refreshments
are served at tables, they sit side by side.
It is proper to send an anniversary present suitable
to the occasion. Such a gift is accompanied by
a card bearing the name of the sender, and the
word “Congratulations.” It is customary to send
such a gift only a day or two before the celebration
of the anniversary.</p>

<p>An anniversary reception is just like a reception
given at any other time, and rules for conducting
such a one apply to this affair. To repeat the
wedding ceremony, as is sometimes done, is in bad
taste.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">CHRISTENING PARTIES</div>

<p>In close sequence to weddings and wedding anniversaries
we give a few general directions for the
conduct of christening-parties.</p>

<p>As the small infant is supposed to be asleep early
in the evening, the christening ceremony should
take place in the morning or afternoon. As it is
not always convenient for the business men of the
family to get off in the daytime on week days,
Sunday afternoon is often chosen for such an affair.</p>

<p>Every prayer-book contains a description of the
duties of godfathers and godmothers, if one belongs
to a church having such. If not, the father
holds the child, and the father and mother take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
upon them the vows of the church to which they
belong. After the religious service the little one
is passed about among the guests, and is then taken
by the nurse to the upper regions, while those assembled
in its honor regale the inner man with
refreshments provided for the occasion.</p>

<p>The godfather and godmother make a gift to
the child—usually some piece of silver or jewelry.
This is displayed on a table in the drawing-room
with any other presents that the invited guests may
bring or send. It is the proper thing for the guests
to congratulate the parents on the acquisition to
the family and to wish the child health and happiness.</p>

<p>Handsome calling gowns are <i>en règle</i> at a christening.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Refreshments are often served <i>en buffet</i> at home
weddings and at receptions but there is always some
awkwardness attached to this method. To provide
small tables for one’s guests to be seated at is
much the better way when it is practicable. You
will seem more hospitable and your guest will be
more comfortable. The person who eats standing
always has a catch-a-train look.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TAKING LEAVE</div>

<p>If obliged for any reason to leave unusually early
at any party, go as quietly as possible. No hostess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
likes to have her entertainment broken off unseasonably.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MARGIN OF MANNERS</div>

<p>Never hesitate at any social gathering to speak
pleasantly to any one you chance to be thrown
with or to respond to any one who speaks to you,
even though no introduction has taken place. In
England, few formal introductions are made,—as
the phrase goes, “the roof is the introduction.”
A passing courtesy of this sort commits you to
nothing while it has a broad social value. Never
indulge in snubs. If you are open to no higher
appeal, remember that it pays to be civil all round.
James has spoken of “the margin of manners,”—it
is a useful asset.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In recent years it has become permissible for
the woman who wishes to give a large entertainment
to do it at a club-house or in a hotel ballroom
hired for the occasion. Frequently the room is
made more attractive by the addition of rugs and
other furnishings from the home of the hostess.
While the hired hall is a convenience, and to the
woman living in an apartment a necessity for receptions
and dances, it can never take in elegance
and the spirit of true hospitality the place of entertaining
under one’s roof. When one sees women
of wealth and leisure resort to it—“Because it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
saves bother, you know”—one feels that these
women must regard the events of social life as
disagreeable duties rather than delightful opportunities.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With us “Bonnets before six but not after” is
the rule, and this is also the custom in England.
But at formal receptions in the evening in France
the hat is retained. The combination of picture-hat
and low-cut gown is particularly attractive and
one wishes that American women would occasionally,
at least, copy it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HAVE PLENTY OF CHAIRS</div>

<p>If you give a musicale be sure you provide plenty
of chairs. To do this one must, unfortunately,
rent folding chairs and these always have a slight
funereal aspect. But that is better than compelling
people to stand. One wonders why women of
large means, who entertain on a corresponding
scale, do not buy several dozen of these chairs and
stain them dark. A woman who spoke of a certain
house as hospitable in appearance, being asked what
she meant, answered, “There are so many places
in it to sit.”</p>

<p>A woman who is not willing to take the trouble
to be a hostess should not ask people to her house.
In order to make even a simple entertainment a
success it is necessary that there should be a directing
though quiet influence. Some women are too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
strenuous as hostesses, others are merely guests at
their own parties. Here as elsewhere there is a
medium course that is most to be desired.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE IDEAL SOCIETY</div>

<p>The spirit of an ideal society has been well expressed
by Amiel in his famous <i>Journal:</i> “In society
people are expected to behave as if they lived
on ambrosia and concerned themselves with nothing
but the loftiest interests. Anxiety, need, passion,
have no existence. All realism is suppressed as
brutal. In a word, what we call ‘society’ proceeds
for the moment on the flattering illusory assumption
that it is moving in an ethereal atmosphere and
breathing the air of the gods. All vehemence, all
natural expression, all real suffering, all careless
familiarity, or any frank sign of passion, are startling
and distasteful in this delicate <i>milieu;</i> they at
once destroy the common work, the cloud palace,
the magical architectural whole, which has been
raised by the general consent and effort. It is like
the sharp cock-crow which breaks the spell of all
enchantments, and puts the fairies to flight. These
select gatherings produce, without knowing it, a
sort of concert for eyes and ears, an improvised
work of art. By the instinctive collaboration of
everybody concerned, intellect and taste hold festival,
and the associations of reality are exchanged
for the associations of imagination. So understood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
society is a form of poetry; the cultivated
classes deliberately recompose the idyll of the
past and the buried world of Astrea. Paradox or
no, I believe that these fugitive attempts to reconstruct
a dream whose only end is beauty represent
confused reminiscences of an age of gold haunting
the human heart, or rather aspirations toward a
harmony of things which every-day reality denies to
us, and of which art alone gives us a glimpse.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">A PERFECT SOCIAL GROUP</div>

<p>Speaking of a certain soirée, the same writer
emphasizes the fact that the most beautiful social
groups are not confined to any one age or sex.
“About thirty people representing our best society
were there, a happy mixture of sexes and ages.
There were gray heads, young girls, bright faces—the
whole framed in some Aubusson tapestries
which made a charming background, and gave a
soft air of distances to the brilliantly-dressed
groups.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>THE HOME WEDDING</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">TO a home wedding, invitations may be issued
two weeks in advance. Their style depends upon
how formal the function is to be. If a quiet
family affair, the notes of invitation may be written
in the first person by the bride’s mother, as:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="unindent">“My Dear Mary:</p>

<p>“Helen and Mr. Jones are to be married on
Wednesday, October the thirteenth, at four o’clock.
The marriage will be very quiet, with none but the
family and most intimate friends present. We hope
that you will be of that number. Helen sends her
love and begs that you will come to see her married.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">“Faithfully yours,</span><br />
”Joanna Smith.”<br />
</p></div>

<p>This kind of note is, of course, only permissible
for the most informal affairs. For the usual home
marriage, cards, which read as follows, may be
issued:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. and Mrs. Nelson Brown request the pleasure
of Mr. and Mrs. Blank’s company at the marriage
of their daughter on the afternoon of Wednesday,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the thirteenth of October, at four o’clock, at One
hundred and forty-four Madison Square, Boston.”</p></div>

<p>Or the invitations may read:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. and Mrs. Nelson Brown request the pleasure
of your company at the marriage of their daughter,
Helen Adams, to Mr. Charles Sprague, on
Tuesday afternoon, October the thirteenth, at four
o’clock.”</p></div>

<p>“R. s. v. p.” may be added if desired. Some
people prefer to “request the honor of,” etc., as
more elegant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WEDDING CARDS</div>

<p>Wedding-cards are enclosed in two envelopes,
with the inner one bearing the name only and left
unsealed.</p>

<p>Sunday weddings are not good form, and Friday
is, owing to the old superstition, not popular. Probably
more weddings take place on Wednesday than
on any other day.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At a home wedding, the bride often has but one
girl attendant, and that one is the maid of honor.
The bride tells her what kind of dress she wishes
her to wear, and the bridegroom provides her bouquet
for her. He also sends the bride her bouquet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MATTER OF EXPENSES</div>

<p>The wedding expenses of the bridegroom are the
flowers for the bride and her maid of honor or
bridesmaids, the carriage in which he takes his
bride to the train, the carriages for best man and
ushers, and the clergyman’s fee. Besides this, he
usually provides his ushers and best man with a
scarf-pin. In some cases he gives these attendants
also their gloves and ties; sometimes he does not.
The bride’s family pays all other expenses, including
the decorating of the house, the invitations and announcement
cards and the caterer. If guests from
a distance are to be met at the train by carriages,
the bride’s father pays for these.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>We will suppose that at the house wedding with
which we have to do the only attendants are the
best man, two ushers and the maid of honor, and
that the ceremony is at high noon, or twelve o’clock.</p>

<p>The matter of lights at this function is largely
a question of taste. If the day be brilliantly clear,
it seems a pity to shut the glorious sunshine from
the house. Therefore many brides decline to have
the curtains drawn at the noon hour. Many persons
prefer the light from the shaded lamps and candles,
as being more becoming than the glare of day.</p>

<p>The wedding-breakfast is provided by a caterer
always when such a thing is possible. It may consist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
of iced or jellied bouillon, lobster cutlets, chicken
pâtés, a salad, with cakes, ices and coffee. This
menu can be added to or elaborated, as inclination
may dictate. Sweetbread pâtés may take the place
of chicken pâtés. A frozen punch may take the
place of the ordinary ices, and, if one wish, a game
course be introduced. A heavy breakfast is, however,
a tedious and unnecessary affair.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE BRIDE’S DRESS</div>

<p>The bride’s dress, if she be a young girl, must be
white with a veil. A train is advisable, as it adds
elegance and dignity to the costume. The waist is
made with a high neck and long sleeves and white
gloves are worn. The veil is turned back from the
face and reaches to the bottom of the train where
it is held in place by several pearl-headed pins. A
single fold of tulle hangs over the face, being separated
from the main veil. This is thrown back
after the ceremony.</p>

<p>The bridegroom wears a black frock coat, gray
trousers, white waistcoat, white tie, light gray or
pearl gloves and patent leather shoes. His ushers
dress in much the same fashion.</p>

<p>The maid of honor wears a gown of white or
very light color, with a slight train, and a picture
hat, or not, as she wishes. When becoming, an entire
costume of pale pink, with a large hat trimmed
with long plumes of the same shade, is very striking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
The bouquet carried by the bridesmaid will
harmonize with the color of her gown. Of course,
the bride’s bouquet will be white, and is usually
composed of her favorite blossoms.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE WEDDING RING</div>

<p>The old fashion of ripping the third finger of
the bride’s left-hand glove, so that this finger might
be slipped off for the adjusting of the ring, is no
longer in vogue. Instead of this the left-hand glove
is removed entirely at that part of the ceremony
when the ring is placed on the bride’s finger by the
bridegroom.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At a house wedding the guests assemble near the
hour named, leave their wraps in the dressing-rooms,
then wait in the drawing-room for the wedding.
The whole parlor-floor is decorated with
natural flowers, garlands of these being twisted
about the balustrades, and making a bower of the
room in which the marriage is to take place. If one
can afford to do so, one may prefer to leave the
matter of floral decorations to an experienced florist,
but any person with taste can successfully decorate
the rooms. A screen of green, dotted with
flowers, may stand at the end of the room in which
the marriage is to be solemnized, and an arch of
flowers is thrown over this. Within this arch the
clergyman, the bridegroom and the best man may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
await the arrival of the wedding guests, as the wedding
march begins.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE WEDDING PROCESSION</div>

<p>The portières, shutting off the drawing-room
from the hall, are closed when the time arrives for
the bridal party to descend the stairs. As they
reach the hall the strains of the wedding march
sound.</p>

<p>One word as to the orchestra. This should be
stationed at such a distance from the clergyman
and bridal party that its strains will not drown the
words of the service. Since Fashion decrees that
music should be played during the service, it should
be so soft and low that it accentuates, rather than
muffles the voices of the participants in the ceremony.
Loud strains detract from the impressiveness
of the occasion, and cause a feeling of irritation
to the persons who would not miss a single
word of the solemn service.</p>

<p>Through the door at the opposite end of the
room from that in which the bridegroom stands,
enters the wedding procession. The two ushers
come first, having a moment or two before marked
off the aisle, by stretching two lengths of white
satin ribbon from end to end of the room. Following
the ushers walks the bridesmaid alone, and,
after her, on the arm of her father, comes the
bride. At the improvised altar, or at the cushions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
upon which the bridal couple are to kneel, the ushers
separate, one going to each side. The maid of
honor moves to the left of the bride, and the father
lays the bride’s hand in the hand of the bridegroom,
then stands a little in the rear until he gives her
away, after which point in the ceremony he steps
back among the guests, or at one side, apart from
the bridal group. The best man stands on the
bridegroom’s right. It is he who gives the ring to
the clergyman, who hands it to the bridegroom,
who places it on the finger of the bride.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RECEIVING CONGRATULATIONS</div>

<p>When the ring is to be put on, the bride hands
her bouquet to the maid of honor, and draws off
her left-hand glove, giving that also to the maid
of honor, who holds both until after the benediction.
After congratulating the newly-wedded pair,
the clergyman gives them his place, and they stand
facing the company, to receive congratulations. The
bride’s mother should have been in the parlor to receive
the guests as they arrived, and during the ceremony
stands at the end of the room near the bridal
party. She should be the first to congratulate the
happy couple, the bridegroom’s parents following
those of the bride. The maid of honor stands by
the bride while she receives.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After congratulations have been extended, the
wedding-breakfast is served at little tables placed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
about the various rooms. The bride and her party
may, if desired, have a table to themselves, and
upon this may be a wedding-cake, to be cut by the
bride. This is not essential and has, of late years,
been largely superseded by the squares of wedding
cake, packed in dainty boxes, one of which is handed
to each guest on leaving.</p>

<p>When the time comes for the bride to change
her dress she slips quietly from the room, accompanied
by her maid of honor. The bridegroom
goes to an apartment assigned to him and his best
man to put on his traveling suit. Later, the maid
of honor may come down and tell the bride’s mother
in an “aside” that she may now go up and bid
her daughter good-by in the privacy of her own
room. Afterward the young husband and wife descend
the stairs together, say good-by in general
to the guests awaiting them in the lower hall, and
drive off, generally, one regrets to say, amid showers
of rice.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">AS TO PRACTICAL JOKES</div>

<p>I would say just here that the playing of practical
jokes on a bridal pair is a form of pleasantry
that should be confined to classes whose intellects
have not been cultivated above the appreciation of
such coarse fun. To tie a white satin bow on the
trunk of the so-called happy pair so that all passengers
may take note of them, is hardly kind. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
jesting compared to some of the
deeds done. A few weeks ago the papers gave an
account of a groomsman who slipped handcuffs
upon the wrists of bride and bridegroom, then lost
the key, and the embarrassed couple had to wait for
their train, chained together, until a file could be
procured, by which time their train had left. Such
forms of buffoonery may be diverting to the perpetrator;
they certainly are not amusing to the
sufferers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE QUIET WEDDING</div>

<p>this is refined A girl who is to be married quietly with only
relatives or intimate friends present often says, in
explaining this fact, “I’m not going to have a <i>wedding</i>.”
The expression is not well chosen, for it
inevitably suggests that the glitter of the ceremony
is in her eyes more important than the solemn words
which <i>are</i> the wedding.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>THE CHURCH WEDDING</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE is about a church wedding a formality
that is dispensed with at a home ceremony.
The cards of invitation may be engraved in the same
form as those described in the last chapter, but the
church at which the marriage is to take place is mentioned
instead of the residence of the bride’s parents.
If in a large city where curiosity seekers are likely to
crowd into the edifice, it is customary to enclose
with the card of invitation a small card to be presented
at the door. Only bearers of these bits of
pasteboard are admitted. With the invitations may
be cards for the reception or the wedding-breakfast
to follow the ceremony. These cards demand acceptances
or regrets, which should always be addressed
to the mother of the bride, never to the
bride-elect.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The decorations for a church wedding may be
elaborate. As a rule, one color scheme is chosen,
and carried out through all the arrangements. For<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
example, the coloring is pink and white, and if the
wedding is in the autumn, chrysanthemums may be
the chosen flowers, if in the summer, roses. The
matter of decorations is usually put into the hands
of a florist.</p>

<p>White satin ribbon is stretched across the pews
to be occupied by the members of the two families
or, more courteously, large bows of it are fastened
at the end of each, and to these pews the destined
occupants are conducted by the ushers a short time
before the bridal party enters the edifice. A list
of the persons entitled to sit in these pews should
be given to the chief usher.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">DUTIES OF THE USHERS</div>

<p>At a large and elaborate wedding six or eight
ushers are often needed. Sometimes an usher follows
the older custom of giving his arm to a lady,
but he may be less formal if he choose and merely
precede her down the aisle. There is an equal number
of bridesmaids, a maid of honor and a best man.
The best man, the bridegroom, and the clergyman
enter the church by the vestry door, and await at
the altar the coming of the bride and her attendants.
The organ, which has been playing for some moments,
announces the arrival of the wedding party
by the opening strains of the wedding march.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WEDDING CEREMONY</div>

<p>When the carriages containing the party arrive
at the church door the ushers go down the canopy-covered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
walk and help the girls to alight, convey
them into the vestibule and close the outer doors
of the church while the procession forms. Then
the inside doors are thrown open and as the organ
peals forth the wedding march, the procession
passes up the aisle at a dignified pace, but not, let
us hope, at the painfully slow gait some persons
think necessary. First, come the ushers, two by
two, next, the bridesmaids in pairs, then the maid
of honor, walking alone, and the bride on the arm
of her father, or other masculine relative if her
father is not living. As the altar is reached the
ushers divide, half the number going to the right,
the other half to the left, then the bridesmaids do
the same, passing in front of the ushers and forming
a portion of a circle nearer the altar. The maid
of honor, who is sometimes now, instead, a matron
of honor, stands near the bride, on her left
hand, and the best man stands near the bridegroom’s
right. The bridegroom, stepping forward to meet
the bride, takes her hand and leads her to their
place in front of the clergyman, the father remaining
standing a little in the rear of the bride and to
one side until that portion of the service is reached
when the clergyman asks, “Who giveth this woman
to be married to this man?” He then takes
his daughter’s hand, and laying it in the hand of the
bridegroom, replies, “I do.” After this he steps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
quietly down from the chancel and takes his place
in the pew with his wife, or the other members of
the family. If the bride’s father is dead his place
may be taken by any middle-aged man relative or
family friend.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">DUTY OF THE BEST MAN</div>

<p>During the ceremony the best man stands at the
right of the bridegroom, and a trifle behind him,
taking charge of his friend’s hat and handing him
the ring when it is needed. It is he, also, who pays
the clergyman and if a register is to be signed, he
signs it. The final responsibility for a ceremony
without an awkward hitch rests on his shoulders and
on those of the maid of honor.</p>

<p>The maid of honor, standing near the bride,
holds her bouquet and takes her glove when the
ring is put on, and continues to hold them until
after the benediction, which the bridal pair kneels
to receive. Then the organ again sounds the wedding
march, and the guests remain standing as the
party assembled at the altar moves down the aisle.
First, comes the bride on her husband’s arm, then
the best man and the maid of honor together, then
the ushers and the bridesmaids, each girl on the
arm of an usher. After that the families of the
bride and bridegroom leave. The bridal party is
driven directly to the home of the bride’s parents,
where the wedding-breakfast is served or, if a reception<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
follows the wedding, where the bride awaits
the arrival of her guests.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ARTISTIC BRIDE</div>

<p>The conventional dress for the bride married in
daylight is the same as for an evening wedding, a
trained white gown with lace or tulle veil. The same
is true of the costumes of the bridesmaids and maid
of honor. These are selected by the bride. At
one pink-and-white wedding the bridesmaids wore
pink dresses with pink picture-hats, while the maid
of honor wore a gown of palest green with hat
to match,—hers being the only touch of any color
but pink in the assembly, and serving to accentuate
the general rose-like scheme. The bridesmaids’
bouquets are of flowers to harmonize with their
costumes. The bride’s bouquet is always white,
bride roses being favorites for this purpose. Brides
with artistic natures who find white satin and orange
blossoms unbecoming, sometimes arrange a softer
costume that is still sufficiently bride-like to satisfy
sentiment. Often little children are used as attendants
for the bride. They precede the maid of
honor and may scatter flower petals down the aisle
as they go. The effect is charming. A matron
of honor must wear a colored costume.</p>

<p>At a day wedding the bridegroom wears a frock
coat, light gray trousers, white waistcoat, white
satin or silk tie and patent leather shoes. Of
course, the only hat permissible with a frock coat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
is a high silk one. The gloves are white, or pale
gray. The ushers’ dress is the same except that
their ties need not be white.</p>

<p>At an evening wedding full dress is, of course,
necessary. Then the bridegroom wears his dress
suit, white waistcoat, white lawn tie and white
gloves. The ushers are dressed in the same manner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GIFTS TO BRIDESMAIDS</div>

<p>It is customary for the bride to give her bridesmaids
some little gift. This may be a stick-pin or
brooch bearing the intertwined initials of the bridal
pair. This pin is usually worn by the recipient at
the wedding.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The bride and the bridegroom with the bridesmaids
stand together at the end of the drawing-room
to receive the guests. An usher meets each
guest at his, or her arrival, and offering his arm,
escorts the newcomer to the bridal pair, asking for
the name as he does so. This name he repeats
distinctly on reaching the bride, who extends her
hand in greeting, and receives congratulations.
The bridegroom is then congratulated, and the
guest straightway makes room for the next comer.</p>

<p>One is often asked what should be said to the
newly-married pair,—what form congratulations
should take, and so on. Stilted phrases are at all
times to be avoided, and the greeting should be as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
simple and straightforward as possible. It is good
form to wish the bride happiness, while the bridegroom
is congratulated. Thus one says to the bride,
“I hope you will be very happy,—and I am sure
you will.” And to the bridegroom one may say,—“You
do not need to be told how much you are
to be congratulated, for you know it already. Still
I do want to say that I congratulate you from my
heart.”</p>

<p>A pretty custom followed by some brides is that
of turning, when half-way up the stairs, after the
reception or breakfast is over, untying the ribbon
fastening the bouquet together, and scattering the
flowers thus released among the men waiting in
the hall below. This disposes of the wedding bouquet
which one has not the heart to throw away,
and yet which one can not keep satisfactorily.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">DISPLAYING GIFTS</div>

<p>If gifts are displayed at a reception, it should
be in an upper room, and all cards should be removed.
The bride may keep a list of her presents
and of the donors, but to display cards gives an
opportunity for invidious comparisons. More and
more the custom of showing gifts, except to intimate
friends in private, is going out.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The tables for the wedding-breakfast may be
placed about the drawing-rooms, and the guests are
seated informally at them. The only exception to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
this rule is the bride’s table at which the bridal
party sits. As artificial lights are usually used at
elaborate functions, even at high noon, pretty candelabra
are upon each table. Or, if preferred, fairy
lamps may take the place of the candelabra.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WEDDING BREAKFAST</div>

<p>The menu for the wedding-breakfast may consist
of grapefruit with Maraschino cherries, or of
oyster cocktails, or of clams on the half-shell, as
a first course; next, hot clam bouillon (unless clams
have already been served) or chicken bouillon; fish
in some form, as fish croquettes with oyster-crab
sauce; sweetbread pâtés with green peas; broiled
chicken or French chops with potato croquettes or
with Parisian potatoes; punch frappé; game with
salad; ices, cakes, coffee. If wines are used, champagne
is served with the breakfast. Slices of the
wedding-cake packed in dainty satin-paper boxes
are given to the guests as they leave.</p>

<p>The breakfast over, the bride slips away quietly,
to change her dress for the wedding journey, and
departs as after a home wedding.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The guests at a wedding-breakfast must call on
the mother of the bride within three weeks after
the marriage. They will, of course, call on the
bride on one of her “At Home” days, the dates
of which are given with the wedding invitations
or with the announcement cards.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">ANNOUNCEMENT CARDS</div>

<p>Announcement cards are issued immediately after
the wedding, so must be addressed and stamped
ready to be mailed at once. The text usually used
is this:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. and Mrs. William Edwin Burnham announce
the marriage of their daughter, Eleanor
Fair, to Mr. John Langdon Morse, on Tuesday, the
eighth of December, one thousand nine hundred and
five, at St. Michael’s Church, Davenport, Iowa.”</p></div>

<p>Another form that is sometimes seen is the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Married, Wednesday, October eleventh, 1903;
Florence Archer and John Staunton, 1019 Penn
Street, Philadelphia.”</p></div>

<p>This last form is seldom used except in cases
where the bride is so unfortunate as to have no
relatives in whose names she may announce her
marriage.</p>

<p>With the announcement cards may be enclosed
another card bearing the dates of the bride’s “At
Home” days, and the hours at which she will receive.
Announcement cards are usually issued after
a small or private wedding to which only a limited
number of guests have been invited. If the wedding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
has been large or was followed by a large
reception to which all one’s calling acquaintances
may be bidden, the announcement cards are unnecessary
and the “At Home” cards are issued with
the invitations to the marriage, or are sent out after
the bride returns from her trip.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE DRESS FOR A WIDOW</div>

<p>The dress for a widow at her second marriage
should be made of some elegant colored fabric and
she should wear a hat if the ceremony is performed
in a church. There should be no attendants except
the father or brother or an intimate friend.</p>

<p>A young girl without parents and of limited income
may quite properly be married in her traveling
costume and with the utmost simplicity. If
she have a proper sense of the delicacy and solemnity
of the occasion she will not, however, go
to the house of a strange clergyman for the ceremony
but have it performed in the parlor of her
nearest friend or relative. In this way she shows
her own good breeding and protects herself from
any idle remarks. For a girl to join her fiancé
in a distant city and marry him there is a step
seldom taken in wisdom, whatever the circumstances.</p>

<p>Notes to all who have sent gifts must be written
by the bride before she leaves home.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>THE DINNER PARTY</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE dinner is the most important and the
most delightful of social functions. It is the
most civilized of entertainments, and to say of a
town that it is a dinner-giving town means that
it has arrived socially. This flower of hospitality
blooms slowly. In many western places where the
reception, the afternoon tea, the theater party and
the ladies’ luncheon flourish like a green bay tree,
the dinner is an unknown function. A young hostess
is often afraid of attempting it, as is also the
unaccustomed diner-out. Yet it is not a formidable
entertainment, rightly considered, and when happily
managed the return it brings far outweighs the
outlay of time and trouble.</p>

<p>The dinner, height of hospitality as it is, is yet
within the reach of most of us as far as expenditure
is concerned. The cost of a dinner may be
much or little. The menu may be simple or elaborate.
Five courses is enough for a dainty satisfying
meal, yet eighteen and twenty are sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
served. The table decorations may be of the most
expensive sort; yet a half-dozen roses and candles
in keeping are sufficient to give a properly festive
touch.</p>

<p>The number of servants required depends, of
course, upon the elaborateness or simplicity of the
menu and upon the number of guests to be served.
The size of the dinner party is elastic, though
eighteen at the table is usually regarded as the
maximum.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE SMALL DINNER</div>

<p>The little dinner party has the advantage of
being in some ways a more attractive function than
the big one, as well as one in which people of small
incomes may safely indulge. When a dinner is so
large that general conversation is impossible, it defeats
its own purpose. Eight guests are a good number.
Why it should be that ten guests are still
so few as to form a little dinner party and that
twelve guests undoubtedly make a big dinner party
is one of those inscrutable truths that it takes something
more than arithmetic to explain. But so it
is. If the guests are properly chosen for a small
dinner there should be in the atmosphere a combination
of pretty formality and agreeable familiarity
about this function that no other can give in so
large a degree.</p>

<p>The choice of guests is, of course, the first and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
most important consideration. Upon this more
than upon any other consideration depends the success
of your party. It does not do to invite people
together for commercial reasons simply or from any
other purely selfish motive. It does not do to go
through one’s list and invite people, by instalments,
straight through the alphabet. The hostess must
exercise all the tact and discrimination of which
she is possessed. It is not always necessary that
the people chosen should be friends and acquaintances
but it is necessary that they have interests,
broadly speaking, of the same sort, that they have
enough in common to make a basis for easy informal
talk. If the people chosen like one another
or have the capacity for interesting and diverting
one another, the hostess should feel that the weightiest
business is off her hands.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">SENDING DINNER INVITATIONS</div>

<p>Dinner invitations should be sent out at least
a week before the date of the function. In places
where social life is of a strenuous character and
people are likely to have many engagements ahead,
two weeks should be allowed. In New York and
Washington, invitations for formal dinners are issued
four weeks before the event. The invitation
to a dinner should be answered immediately. As
the number of guests invited in any case is small,
the hostess should know as soon as possible the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
intention of those invited, so that, in case of a
regret, she may fill the place so quickly that the
person next chosen may not realize that he is an
alternate. The letters R. s. v. p. should not be
put on a dinner invitation. Any one who receives
such a card or note is supposed to understand that
an answer is expected.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE DINNER MENU</div>

<p>When the guests are selected, the invitations delivered
and the proper number of acceptances received,
the hostess may then turn her attention to
the other arrangements. The important matter of
deciding upon the menu is next in order. If the
hostess has an admirably trained cook or is in a
position to engage an expert cateress, a consultation
with one or the other settles the affair. In
case she has not the one and is not financially able
to engage the other, she must depend upon her own
resources. She must select a menu which she and
her maid can together carry out successfully.</p>

<p>The composition of a dinner menu is an employment
that gives scope for talent and originality.
The range of possible dishes is large, the variety in
the way of combination inexhaustible. To plan a
dinner that is at once palatable and pleasing to
the eye requires no mean ability. To a woman who
has a genius for culinary feats, this sort of accomplishment
may be an exercise of the artistic faculties;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
and the effect produced upon the partakers of
the feast goes far beyond mere physical satisfaction.
If one is in the habit of studying cook-books,
which make more interesting reading than they are
generally given credit for, the opportunity afforded
by a dinner party for the display of one’s knowledge
should be as eagerly welcomed as the opportunity
offered a violinist for the exhibition of his
art. Novelties are to be indulged in sparingly.
Queer highly-colored dishes make the guests nervous
as to the hygienic results.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ROUND OR SQUARE TABLES</div>

<p>Sometimes fashion decrees that a square or oblong
table is the appropriate form. Again she
approves the round table. At the present time the
round table has the preference and, as far as the
present writer can see, with reason. The round
table puts all the diners on an equal footing instead
of establishing a sometimes embarrassing distinction
between guests and hosts. Its use makes
it possible for each guest to have a good view of
every other guest and this promotes general conversation.
Added to these merits is another of
importance, namely, that a round table is more susceptible
of attractive decoration.</p>

<p>Many people who employ a square table for family
use, employ on formal occasions a round top,
capable of seating twelve or fourteen people, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
top can be placed above the table commonly in use.
This top when not in use folds together on hinges
in the center. On occasion it can be clamped to
the table in ordinary so that it holds perfectly firm.</p>

<p>One should not ask more guests than the table
will roomily accommodate. A woman guest will
often be glad of a footstool.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE SILVER AND CHINA</div>

<p>On the morning of the dinner the silver and
china necessary should be looked over and later in
the day properly placed. The table should be arranged
with cloth, the napkins, the various knives,
forks and spoons, the flowers, the candles, and the
service plates, if such are used. The china to be
employed for the various courses should be placed,
before the dinner, in the butler’s pantry in a way
to promote, as far as possible, swift and deft service
with the maid. She should be instructed exactly
where she can lay her hands on the dishes
for each item in the menu so that her attendance
may be expert and noiseless. For her benefit it
is well also to make out in good legible writing,
the menu for the meal and hang it in the kitchen
in full view of her and any other servants employed
for the occasion. In giving a dinner nothing should
be left to chance. Every emergency should be taken
into consideration and planned for. In small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
households where only one maid is employed, a
trained waitress may be hired at small expense to
help serve.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FLOWERS AND CANDLES</div>

<p>The flowers to be used should have some relation
to the color of the candles if candles are used.
A few flowers skilfully arranged are sometimes
quite as effective as a profusion. A clear glass
jar which shows stems and leaves as well as blooms
is a good investment for the woman whose love
of beauty goes further than her ability to pay. The
importance of foliage is not always appreciated.
One of the cleverest minor inventions for making
a few blossoms appear to their best advantage is
the cross-bar of wire which one finds now in the
shops, in various sizes and fitted to the tops of
various ornamental vases. By the use of this device
each flower stands out in individual beauty.
The effect of no single blossom is lost.</p>

<p>Avoid a centerpiece that is so high as to obstruct
the view across the table.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">LAYING THE TABLE</div>

<p>The table-cloth and napkins should be of pure
white and of the finest napery that one can afford.
Silk and lace contraptions that will not stand washing
are in bad taste. The table-cloth is not starched
and preferably is never folded by the laundress but
rolled so that when used it shows no creases except
one down the center. First on the table is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
laid a heavy felt cloth known as the silence cloth,
which, besides deadening sounds, serves to make the
damask lie more smoothly and gives it a richer,
handsomer appearance than if it were spread on
the bare boards. If the game or joints are to be
served from the table, a carver’s square should be
laid at the head of the table and beneath it a thick
mat for the protection of the table surface. Beside
this square are laid the carving knife and fork,
a table spoon and a gravy ladle. At each guest’s
place, is set a “service plate,” insisted on by the
punctilious who choose to obey the unwritten rule
of hospitality that a guest once seated is never without
a plate. This plate is exchanged by the waitress
for the one bearing the food when it is served.
To the left of this plate will be arranged the forks,
tines upward. These will ordinarily consist of two
large forks for the main meat course and the salad,
then a third fork for the fish and outside of these
a small oyster fork if there is to be a course of
raw oysters. At the right of the plate will be two
dinner knives with the edges of the blades turned
toward the plate, a fish knife, and the spoons, including
first a small spoon for the after-dinner coffee.
The spoon that will be used first is placed on
the outside for obvious reasons. The soup spoon
with the bowl uppermost will be placed either at
right angles to the knives or from right to left back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
of the plate. The water glass and the glasses for
wine, if these are used, stand to the right and back,
a little beyond the knives. As butter is not served
at formal dinners the bread and butter plate and
butter spreader are omitted. The folded napkin
containing the dinner roll is laid to the right of
the knives or on the service plate. Fancy foldings
of the napkin are not approved.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE SKILFUL MAID</div>

<p>When the waitress hands a dish from which the
guest must serve himself she offers it on the left
so that he may use his right hand freely. However,
when she puts a plate before him, she should do
it from the right. Many hostesses decree that on
clearing the table, the large meat and vegetable
dishes should be taken first and the soiled plates
last. A reversal of this procedure would seem to
be an improvement as the untidy plates are the
least sightly things about the table. If the maid
is skilful she will notice whether any guest has
by chance already used the spoons or other silver
required for the dessert course and supply those
without a request being made.</p>

<p>In clearing the table the maid must not stack
the dishes. She should take a plate in each hand
and no more.</p>

<p>Avoid using heavily scented flowers on a dinner
table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Menu cards do not belong in private houses.
They have the somewhat vulgar effect of laying
too much stress on the food. The ideal dinner is,
indeed, a delightful repast, but it should be first
of all what has been wittily described as “a feast
of reason and a regular freshet of soul.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE FRUIT CENTERPIECE</div>

<p>A fruit centerpiece is not often seen but it is
handsome. A large silver plate or basket heaped
with pink and white winter grapes or even with
rosy apples and “glove” oranges is most effective.</p>

<p>If candles are used these should be kept on ice
until near the dinner hour, then lighted and the
wicks cut, to prevent smoking and dripping. Many
persons who like to put shades on their candles
have difficulty in preventing them from catching
fire. It is worth knowing that this is more likely
to occur when the holders are fitted to the top of
the candle than where they clasp it below the heated
part.</p>

<p>When a dessert dish is placed on a larger plate,
or a finger-bowl is set before the guest, a small
lace paper mat may be laid between plate and dish.</p>

<p>If the dining-room floor is of hard wood rubber
tips may be bought at any department store and
put on the chair-legs to prevent the noise of scraping.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>The table should be carefully set so that the
centerpiece is exactly in the center and the guests’
places precisely opposite each other.</p>

<p>As a rule the china used throughout a dinner
exactly matches, but if a hostess prefers she may
use different sets for different courses.</p>

<p>In serving soup be careful not to give too much.
A half ladleful is an “elegant sufficiency.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE TEMPERATURE OF WINES</div>

<p>If a dinner is very formal and several wines are
to be served, it is correct to use white wine with
the fish, sherry with the soup, claret with the roast
and champagne or Burgundy with the game. The
white wine, sherry and champagne should be kept
cold; champagne, indeed, should be very cold and is
served from a bottle wrapped in a napkin. Claret
and Burgundy are most agreeable at a temperature
of about seventy. All these wines are served
from the bottle except claret and sherry, which are
usually decanted, that is to say, they are poured
from the original bottle into a cut-glass bottle or
decanter intended especially for table use.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Much of the success of a dinner depends upon
the serving. A well-trained maid or man is indispensable,
and it is not to be denied that the
training, for this purpose, of the average servant
to be found in the West is difficult. But with patience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
it can be done. If one is in the habit, as
one should be, of insisting that the home dinner
be served with proper formality, the extra duties
involved in the service of a larger number of people
and of a greater range of dishes need not be viewed
with terror.</p>

<p>If there are ten or twelve guests the services of
two maids or men become necessary, lest the portions
on the plates become cold before the sauces
and vegetables that are to accompany them can be
passed. For elaborate dinners the rule is one
waiter to every three guests.</p>

<p>In punctilious households the unwritten law that
a guest should never be without a plate before him
is observed, and this is known as the service or
place plate. At an informal meal this plate may be
dispensed with.</p>

<p>A maid should be taught to move quietly, to
keep her eyes and thoughts on what she is
doing, and in an emergency to go directly
to her mistress for a quiet word of instruction.
It is particularly important that the domestic
in the kitchen should also be as quiet as
possible in her movements. Nothing is more annoying
during a dinner conversation than a crash
of crockery in the culinary regions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HOUR FOR DINNER</div>

<p>As a rule dinner is served in most American
cities at seven o’clock. In New York, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
where long distance makes it difficult for men to
reach home, dress for the evening and arrive at
any stated place, eight o’clock is frequently the hour.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">SAYING GRACE</div>

<p>In not a few houses the fine old fashion of
saying grace is still observed and the guest should
carefully watch his hostess for a cue as to how
to conduct himself. A young woman who happened
to be visiting in one of the older New England
families chanced to take her first meal at the
dinner hour. After a moment’s pause she was
asked by her hostess to start the meal, and with
best intentions she did so by passing a bread plate
near her. To her dismay she afterward learned
that she had been expected to say grace. Of course,
such an incident could occur only at an informal
dinner, but it serves to bring up the point that
many a hostess embarrasses a guest by directly
asking him to perform this service which a natural
timidity or his being unaccustomed to it may make
an ordeal for him. If a clergyman is present, respect
to his position, whatever one’s own religious
convictions or want of them, demands that he be
asked to say grace.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At informal dinners the roast may be carved at
the table if the hostess prefers this plan and if
the host can be persuaded to do the carving and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
is able to do it skilfully and quietly. This plan,
which is English in its origin, seems more hospitable
in a way than the more formal custom of
serving everything from side-tables, <i>a la Russe</i>.
Undoubtedly there is a flavor of the hotel and
restaurant about the Russian style that is less agreeable,
though simpler and more expeditious. It may
be remarked, however, that while it is of first importance
that a dinner service should move promptly
and that it should not at the outside take up more
than two hours, anything that actually suggests
haste is contrary to the spirit of the occasion.</p>

<p>When the meats are carved at the table the
vegetables should be passed by the maid, as the
guests may have a choice. For the person at the
head of the table to serve both meat and vegetables
is permissible only at a family dinner. In some
households the host or hostess makes a specialty
of salad dressing, and this course, also, is served
at the table. As the salad bowl may be so arranged
as to present a beautiful, as well as a delicious sight,
the custom has more than one reason to recommend
it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">WHO IS SERVED FIRST</div>

<p>As to who is served first there has been considerable
discussion. The plan has recently come
into favor in some houses to hand the first plate
in each instance to the hostess in the thought that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
if there is anything wrong with the dish she may
detect it before the guests are served. The usual
plan, however, is to serve first the lady sitting at
the host’s right hand, then all the other ladies, and
lastly the men. Or, if two maids are serving, one
may take one side of the table and one the other.
The maid should hand the dishes on the left side
of the guest. A clever maid can wait on eight
people, provided the dinner is not too elaborate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">DRESS OF BUTLER AND MAID</div>

<p>The dress of a maid waiting at dinner should
be in winter of a plain black stuff, in summer of
plain white. Over this is worn a white bib apron
with bands going over the shoulders. The skirt
of the apron should be large so that the front of
the dress is protected. A plain white collar and
white cuffs and a white cap without strings or
crown complete this costume. No ornaments of
any sort are permissible.</p>

<p>A butler should wear the ordinary dress suit
with a white tie. It is a matter of wonder to the
thoughtful why society has not yet found a way
to clothe her butlers and waiters in some manner
that shall prevent strangers from taking them for
guests, but as yet no such way seems to have been
found. In default of a butler many families keep
what is known as a house-man, who performs the
duties of both butler and footman; that is to say,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
he opens the door and also assists at table. Such
a servant has a white linen jacket and dark trousers,
though some women who have negro house-men
and a taste for the picturesque prefer that
they shall wear dark colored coats with brass buttons
and a scarlet or other bright colored waistcoat.
While one sees in certain nice houses white
gloves on the hands of a house-man when he is
waiting at table, the best taste is against their use,
as they undeniably suggest that they are worn to
hide dirty hands.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">WHAT TO WEAR AT DINNER</div>

<p>At formal dinners a woman is expected to wear
a dress cut moderately low in the neck, while for
men what is known as evening dress is imperative.
Sometimes an invitation contains the word “informal,”
but unless one has explicit direction to
the contrary, no departure should be made from
the usual method of dressing.</p>

<p>When a dinner is hastily arranged for an out-of-town
guest, who is perhaps passing through the
city for the day only, or for some distinguished
man or woman on a tour of lectures, the hostess
may particularly request the guests not to wear
evening clothes out of consideration for the guest
of honor who, not expecting any social courtesies,
is not prepared so to dress himself. In such cases
the men will wear their day clothes, though a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
woman is always privileged to make her evening
toilet somewhat more dainty and elaborate than her
daytime one. Not to appear in one’s best when
the occasion is suited to happy raiment is to do
both one’s self and the occasion an injustice. Most
people are at their best when they have the consciousness
of being attractively attired, and one
may be sure that the hostess always appreciates any
effort made by her guests toward increasing the
charm of the social picture which she has composed.
A dark or dowdy dress is an ugly note
in such a group and reveals in the woman who
causes it an insufficient sense of the compliment
that has been extended to her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE DINNER COAT</div>

<p>The dinner coat, or Tuxedo, was designed to be
worn only on the most informal occasions, though
there is a tendency to widen its field of usefulness.
The theory is that it should never be worn where
there are ladies, but the modern practise has broken
the theory down so that at small dinners, the theater,
club affairs, etc., the dinner coat is worn by men
who give the subject of dress intelligent consideration.
With the dinner coat a black silk string tie
should be worn; this the wearer should tie in a bow,
tightly drawn at the center. Gray ties have been
urged by the fashion makers, but they are not so
good as the black. The white lawn tie should never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
be worn with the dinner coat. Gold studs and gold
link cuff buttons, or the newer dark enamel should
be used, in shirts of plaits or tucks of various
widths. These softer styles of shirts are now in
high favor and are a sensible and proper innovation.
Extremes of styles should be avoided, and many
men of conservative tastes still wear the stiff plain
linen or piqué bosoms. A black waistcoat of the
same material as the coat is preferable to the fancier
forms.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE LOW-CUT GOWN</div>

<p>It is gratifying to note that in the best houses
neither the hostess nor any woman guest is seen
to appear with a dress improperly low. A woman,
not long used to the better social circle into which
she married, was once invited to meet an actress
at a private dinner party. To the amazement and
distress of her hostess she appeared in a gown that
evidently carried out her idea of what is “Bohemian.”
She had quite clearly been determined
not to be outdone by the actress. To her chagrin
she found this woman in a gown much higher than
her own and wholly modest in every particular.
To govern one’s dress or conduct in society by
any notion of outdoing some one else is an indication
of the parvenu and likely to meet with dire
results.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Those who entertain often soon learn to discriminate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
between the guest whose presence helps to
make a dinner a success and one who is an undigested
lump in the social leaven. The desirable
guest is not necessarily a wit or a beauty but she
comes with a glad mind and heart, arrayed in her
prettiest and with the sincere intention of trying
to give pleasure. She realizes the compliment of
her invitation and that it can not be acknowledged
merely by extending a similar one. She must, as
some one recently put it, “pay her scat” before
she leaves the house. If her dearest enemy is present
nothing in <i>her</i> manner will betray that fact to
the hostess.</p>

<p>The meal should be announced by the servant
in charge opening the door or doors leading into
the dining-room and saying, “Dinner is served.”
It saves confusion even at a small dinner to mark
the places at table by cards inscribed with the
appropriate name, but this is not obligatory.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DINNER PROCESSION</div>

<p>The host, with the lady who is to sit at his right,
is the first to leave the drawing-room. The order
of the other couples does not matter, except that
the hostess, with the man who is to sit at her right,
leaves last. The places of honor are those at the
right of the host and the hostess. If the President
were a guest, the hostess would lead the way to
the dining-room with him, the President’s wife
coming immediately after with the host. If two ladies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
are entertaining, one must play the part of host.
At very large and formal dinners trays on which are
small envelopes are placed in the men’s dressing-room,
each envelope bearing the name of the woman
the guest to whom it is addressed is to take in, and
indicating by the letter L. or R. in the corner of
the card on which side the two will sit.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">ARRIVING AT A DINNER</div>

<p>A dinner party demands that the guest be not
more than ten minutes early, and ordinarily not
a half-minute behind the time mentioned in the
invitation. In large cities, however, on account of
the great distances, ten or fifteen minutes’ grace is
allowed. After that interval has passed, the hostess—or
her butler if she have one—should see that
the cover laid for this person is removed, and the
usual announcement made that “Dinner is served.”
The servant at the door directs the women to their
dressing-room, the men to theirs. In the dressing-room
the women leave their wraps, but do not remove
their gloves. Each woman, accompanied by
her escort, descends to the drawing-room, greets
the hosts, and the man who is to take her out to
dinner is then introduced to her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Where there are many courses a guest may, if
he wish, sometimes decline one or more of these.
He may also show by a gesture that he will not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
take wine, or, if his glasses are filled, he may simply
lift them to his lips, taste the contents, then
drink no more. As a glass will be filled as soon
as emptied, the guest may say in a low voice, “No
more, please!” when he has had enough. None
of these refusals should be so marked as to attract
the attention of his entertainers. A wine-glass
should never be turned down.</p>

<p>After the ladies have removed their gloves and
the dinner-roll or slice of bread has been taken
from the folded napkin and the napkin laid in the
lap, the dinner conducts itself. The chapter headed
“At Table” will answer any doubtful questions as
to the manner of eating at home or abroad.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">WHEN DINNER IS OVER</div>

<p>After the dinner is ended, the hostess gives a
slight signal, or makes the move to rise. The gentlemen
stand while the ladies pass out of the room,
then sit down again for their cigars, coffee and
liquors. The chairs, on rising from a dinner-table,
should not be pushed back in place. Coffee and
cordials are served to the ladies in the drawing-room,
where they are soon joined by the gentlemen.</p>

<p>When the time for departure approaches it is
the place of the woman who goes first to rise, motion
to her husband, and then as soon as she and
he have said good night to the host and hostess,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
they bow to the other guests, and retire to the
dressing-rooms. After this they go directly from
the house, not entering the drawing-room again.
If there are guests of honor they should be the first
to go.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">SAYING GOOD NIGHT</div>

<p>In saying good night it is perfectly proper, extremists
to the contrary notwithstanding, to thank
the entertainers for a pleasant evening. Such
thanks need not be profuse, but may be simply—“Good
night, and many thanks for a delightful evening!”
or “It is hard to leave, we have had such
a pleasant time!” One need never be afraid to
let one’s hosts know that the time spent in their
presence has passed delightfully.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE SUCCESSFUL DINNER</div>

<p>Given well-prepared food, whether simple or
elaborate, proper service, a room not too warm
and a current of fresh air that does not blow on
any one, guests sympathetically chosen, the dinner
can not fail to be a success. A young married
belle of a western city who was visiting in a smart
New York set was asked at her first dinner what
people in the West did for after-dinner entertainment.
“They talk,” she said. The people present
looked at her as if they thought that a dull way
of spending the time, and to a query of hers regarding
their methods of entertainment, replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
that they usually “had in” a professional or professionals
of some sort for the amusement of the
guests after the eating and drinking were over.
To her taste this indicated an unenviable mental
poverty, as it will to most sensible people. The
best flavor of a successful dinner party lies not in
the food, however grateful that may be to the palate,
but in the talk. A dinner is the entertainment
at which sprightly natural talk counts for the most;
and this is probably the reason that the world over
the dinner is considered the most elegant and distinguished
form of entertainment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>THE EDUCATION OF A YOUNG GIRL</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">IS IT a good thing to send a young girl away to
school, and, if so, shall one send her to boarding-school
or college? are the questions that agitate
many a household where the daughter or daughters
are old enough to make these questions pertinent.
Over-conscientious and fearful mothers sometimes
decide that the risk is too great in sending girls
away from home. They fear, with the loosening of
home ties, a lessening of a sense of responsibility,
while at the same time they doubt a girl’s power
to get on without maternal supervision. The judgment
and experience of the world is against this
point of view. “Homekeeping youths have ever
homekeeping wits,” is no more true of boys than
of girls. Going away to school should be one of
the richly vitalizing influences of life. To a certain
extent a girl is thrown on her own resources when
away as she would not be at home, yet the conditions
in any school worthy of the name are such
that she is guarded and protected. At home, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
friendships and acquaintances have been made
largely through the connection of her family with
the community in which she lives. Away, she must
make her own friends. At home, it is probable that
mother, older sister or a kindly aunt have done her
darning and other mending. Away, she must do
these things for herself or they remain undone.
In many ways the opportunity is given her by a
year or two away at school to prove herself, yet to
do so without danger, as the amateur swordsman
fences with a button on his foil. Outside of these
considerations one of the most important is the development
that comes through delight in change.
Novel conditions have charm for all ages, and in
youth, much more than in age, they are a spur to
endeavor. Happiness of a healthful kind stimulates
the mind, and it is commonly true that the
years spent away at school are pleasant ones.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">WHAT SCHOOL TO CHOOSE</div>

<p>The advocates of the different sorts of training
represented by boarding-school and college life are
often hostile to each other. There is much to be
said in favor of both educational methods, and the
decision concerning which shall be adopted for a
young girl should depend largely upon her own
temperament, tastes and inclinations. The advocates
of college life are too apt to assume that the
texture of boarding-school learning is flimsy, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
it sometimes is. The friends of boarding-school
life assume that a college training means an absence
of regard for the feminine graces; and it is
true that some of its representatives are not social
successes. But such comment goes a short way in
helping one to a decision as to whether boarding-school
or college shall be the destination of one’s
daughter.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BOARDING-SCHOOL</div>

<p>The character of the girls’ colleges in our country
is much more generally known than that of
boarding-schools. The colleges are few in number,
and to their proceedings is given a degree of
publicity not accorded the proceedings of smaller
educational enterprises. There are boarding-schools
and boarding-schools. Investigation can not be too
careful before placing a girl in one of them. The
best offer advantages of an admirable kind. The
courses of study, while not so diverse as those of
college, are particularly adapted to feminine tastes,
while the accomplishments which tend to make social
life more interesting and agreeable are given
a large share of attention. History, literature, the
modern languages, music and drawing have perhaps
the foremost places in the curriculum. Many
of these schools are in cities where opportunities
are given, under proper chaperonage, for girls to
see the best theatrical performances and to hear
concerts of value. In these schools girls come into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
more intimate relations with their teachers than is
possible in a college, and they are also much more
strictly chaperoned. Matters of form and deportment,
details of manner, so far as they can be taught,
are given thought and attention often with happy
results. One may say that a girl should learn these
things at home, but sometimes her surroundings
there are not favorable and again she needs the impetus
of just such criticism as she receives at a good
boarding-school to make her aware of the value
of form. The aim of a good boarding-school is
to make of a girl an attractive member of society
as well as to make her mentally appreciative. The
stamp of certain admirable boarding-schools upon
the manners of the women who have attended them
is unmistakable. I once heard a man say that he
could always “spot” a pupil of Miss Porter’s famous
Farmington School within half an hour after introduction,
by certain delicate formalities in her manner.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE WOMAN’S COLLEGE</div>

<p>A woman’s college offers a much wider sphere for
a girl’s energies and abilities than does boarding-school.
If she loves study, is fond of athletics and
is interested widely in human nature, college is the
place for her. Here she has a chance for the development
of her best mental powers. Deportment
is not one of the unwritten branches of the curriculum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
as it is in the girls’ boarding-school. Nevertheless
it is taught by the social preeminence of
those who bring the best breeding with them.
Though the surveillance is not what it is in boarding-schools,
it is not so necessary, because the girls
are somewhat older than those in boarding-schools
and because the sentiment of the students generally
is for law and order.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WELL-KNOWN COLLEGES</div>

<p>The best-known girls’ colleges in the United
States are situated in the country, and the opportunity
thus given for sport and for a healthy appreciation
of nature is an invaluable asset for those institutions.
At no time in life is the love of beauty
at once so delicate and so keen as in those years
when one is eligible to college life. To foster this
perhaps latent appreciation by a direct contact with
the beauties of nature is one of the opportunities
offered by Bryn Mawr, Vassar, Wellesley, Smith
and other well-known women’s colleges.</p>

<p>The three or four years in college among a hundred
or more other girls often form one of the
happiest and most fruitful periods of a girl’s life.
She makes interesting and valuable friendships.
Often her knowledge of the world is broadened by
visits paid to her schoolmates in vacation time. The
advantages she derives from properly directed study
are great; the advantages in other directions are
possibly even greater. A women’s college is a little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
world in which every variety of femininity may be
observed. The life there gives opportunity for the
development of the most diverse talents. Any sort
of capability eventually finds scope for action in
college life. The serious side and the recreative
side of life find expression there. A girl who lends
herself freely to the opportunities of a college should
quit its doors prepared for social and domestic life
and able also to take care of herself financially if
exigencies require.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The comparative cost of college and boarding-school
is often an important point in the matter of
deciding a girl’s educational destination. The best
boarding-schools are more expensive than the colleges
as far as formal expenditure is concerned. A
girl’s personal expenses, though they are regulated
in some boarding-schools, are in college and at most
boarding-schools what she and the family council
choose to make them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">TRAVEL AS EDUCATION</div>

<p>If college and boarding-school exercise a beneficial
influence upon the development of a girl’s
mind and manners, travel is a happy third in the
list. Unfortunately travel is an expensive luxury.
If, however, the financial circumstances of a girl’s
parents are such that she may travel for six months
or a year after her schooling is over, this puts the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
finishing touch upon her educational opportunities.
Travel is the easiest, the quickest and the most delightful
manner of gaining knowledge in the world,
while, at the same time, it is what study is not always,
an encouragement to social facility.</p>

<p>The young girl must be educated at home as well
as away from home. The foundation for such accomplishments
as she has a preference for must be
laid there and she must prepare there, in however
slight a way, for the responsibilities that may rest
upon her shoulders when she has a house of her
own. For her own training, as well as the relief
of her mother, every girl should assume some household
duty or duties. But these, unless necessity
commands, should not be severe, and occasional laxity
in performance should not be dealt with harshly.
Young girlhood is a growing time and a dreaming
time; and a too stern insistence upon household
duties sometimes blights important capabilities of
mind and body.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">ACQUIRING ACCOMPLISHMENTS</div>

<p>It was an old-fashioned idea that every girl
should be equipped with an accomplishment, should
cultivate some definite ability to please. The idea
was much abused, and resulted in the torture of
many innocent persons who were compelled to look
at crude sketches, to admire grotesque embroideries
and to listen to mediocre performances on the piano.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
But there was at the bottom of the idea something
sound and wholesome. It is vitally important
that women should please, should help to make the
wheels of life go easily. That was not an ignoble
epitaph discovered on an old tombstone in an English
churchyard, “She was so pleasant.” Perhaps
in the matter of education we are now swinging too
far away from the old-fashioned ideal and are too
much inclined to regard as trifling a young girl’s
special efforts to please. Do we not somewhat puritanically
regard the studies one does not like as necessarily
more efficacious than those pursued with
joy? Drawing, music, the modern languages, the art
of reciting or conversation—we speak of these usually
not only as secondary in importance to the study
of Greek, Latin and mathematics, but as involving
little in the way of labor, while the truth is that the
pursuit of these subjects not only involves endless
labor but a labor that in the end unveils personality
and individuality, and makes for original interpretation
of life to a degree far exceeding results from
the so-called severer branches.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE DILETTANTE</div>

<p>The theory is generally disseminated that those
studies which give most pleasure to one’s self and
to others when actually transformed into accomplishments
are easy of attainment and demand only
the careless and dilettante touch. The elders as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
as the youth are much impregnated with this idea.
Let a girl understand when she begins to study
drawing, the violin, the pianoforte or the art of
singing that no success is possible without hard
work, that the privilege of lessons will be withdrawn
if she does not put effort and determination
into her work, and results of a correspondingly
good character may be forthcoming.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THOROUGHNESS NECESSARY</div>

<p>For the happiness of themselves and their friends,
it is well that young girls should pursue any accomplishment
toward which they may have a leaning.
Certainly such a pursuit, if entered into with delicacy
and vivacity, must increase the sweetness of
life by adding to one’s sense of beauty; and it is
never trite to say that a thing of beauty is a joy
forever.</p>

<p>Pursuit of an accomplishment does not always
mean possession, but where it does, even measurably,
it means also the power of imparting pleasure
to one’s friends, and pleasure that is touched upon
and mingled with one’s own individuality. In a
day when wealth counts for so much in relation to
the bestowal of pleasure, one can scarcely overestimate
for those who do not have wealth the value of
the personal touch in the entertainment of one’s
friends.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>THE DÉBUTANTE</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">A CLEVER young girl, when asked by an acquaintance
if she had “come out” yet, answered,
“I didn’t come out. I just <i>leaked</i> out.”
Doubtless this states the case, in a somewhat slangy
manner, for a large number of young women who,
gradually and without any set function to serve as
introduction, take their places in society. Even for
them, however, the year following the close of
school duties marks a change in their relation to the
social world, while the distinction is much emphasized
in the case of young girls to whom the affairs
of balls, receptions, teas and calls are a novelty.
The date of a girl’s formal entrance into the larger
world marks her individual recognition in that
world. Before this time she has been a person
without social responsibility, not accountable in the
social sense. She has been considered in relation
to her family, perhaps. Now she stands for herself.
She is an object of some curiosity to the public, and
the pleasures and duties to which she falls heir deserve
some special mention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE AGE OF A DÉBUTANTE</div>

<p>The age at which a girl makes her formal appearance
on the scene of society varies in different
places and with varying conditions. It is rarely under
eighteen, seldom over twenty-two, the first being
the age at which a girl not desirous of extended
education escapes, usually, from the schoolroom,
the second being the average age of graduation for
the college girl. A girl younger than eighteen is
commonly too immature to be considered an interesting
member of society, and a certain degree of
absurdity attaches to the idea of introducing to the
world a girl older than the age last mentioned.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The special function by which a young woman’s
family signalizes her entrance to society varies little
in different places. In many cities the custom is
for the family of the débutante and also for the
friends of the family to give some entertainment in
her honor. A dinner, a luncheon, a tea, a ball—any
one of these festivities is a proper manner of announcing
one’s interest in the new member of society
and of emphasizing her arrival.</p>

<p>Everything should be done to facilitate for her
an extension of acquaintance among those whom
it is desirable she should know. It is said that a
number of years ago when telephones were a luxury
instead of being, as now, a necessity, in southern
cities, the advent of the débutante in a house meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
always the addition of a name to the telephone directory.
This is a somewhat extravagant and florid
comment on the idea advanced. But it will serve as
an illustration. Particularly is it desirable that the
débutante should become acquainted with the older
members of the society in which she moves. She
is now not only a part of the particular set to which
her age assigns her; she is also a part of that larger
society to which many ages belong. Her attitude
on this question distinguishes her as well-bred or
ill-bred. There is nothing more crass and crude
than the young girl who has no eyes or ears for
anybody out of the particular set of young people
to which she belongs. It is the mark of the plebeian.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE DÉBUTANTE’S WARDROBE</div>

<p>The clothes of the débutante are a matter of importance
and her wardrobe should be carefully
planned. It is natural that she should wish to look
pretty and, as youth itself makes for beauty, given
good health and the usual number of features properly
distributed, there is no reason why she should
not so appear, if some discretion be exercised in the
selection of her clothes. It does not lie within the
province of this book to stipulate in detail concerning
the outfit necessary for this happy result. The
purpose of this paragraph is to insist on simplicity
of style in the gowns chosen for a girl’s first year in
society. Elaborate styles and heavy materials are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
opposed to the quality of a young girl’s beauty.
They kill the loveliness which it is their object to
bring out. All her clothes should be made without
perceptible elaboration. In ball gowns she should
be careful to select light, diaphanous materials,—materials
that she can wear at no other time of life
to such advantage. Of party gowns she should
have a number. Three or four frocks of thin inexpensive
materials are far better, if a choice be
necessary, than one heavy silk or satin. They are
more becoming and the number of them guarantees
to their owner perfect freshness and daintiness
of appearance. A soiled, bedraggled ball gown is
a sorry sight on anybody. It looks particularly ill
on a young person whose age entitles her to be compared
to lilies and roses.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE SECOND SEASON</div>

<p>If the truth be told, despite the gaiety and the
novelty of a girl’s first year in society, it is not usually
so pleasant a year as her second. She has much
to learn, and it is the exceptional girl who does not
feel a little awkward in her new position. She is
prone to exaggerate the importance of small social
blunders, and trifles, light as air, occupy a disproportionate
place in her horizon. A certain timidity,
the result of her unaccustomed position, is characteristic
of her. This timidity shows itself either in
a stiffness that modifies considerably her proper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
charm, or in an unnatural bravado of manner, the
reverse of pleasing. “Why are you so down on débutantes?”—the
writer of this chapter asked of an
accomplished young society man. “Because they
think it’s clever to be rude,” was the answer. The
desire to be very apt, to be “on the spot” and “all
there,” as the slang phrase has it,—this is often at
the bottom of the apparent rudeness of the young
girl. She does not care to show her newness. As
a bride wishes it to seem that she has always been
married, so a débutante likes to present the appearance
of thorough familiarity with the ground upon
which she has just arrived.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LOSING SELF-CONSCIOUSNESS</div>

<p>Nothing will assist the débutante to self-control
and a surer footing so much as contact with people
who are somewhat older than herself and who have
gained a proper perspective. From them she will
learn to be less self-conscious, and this means to be
happier and more interesting.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>MEN AND WOMEN</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE is some difference of opinion as to
whether properly a man should ask permission
to call upon a woman or the woman should confer
the favor of her own volition. Sometimes this depends
on the age of the woman under consideration.
The invitation to call of a mature woman of society
is the bestowal of a social favor in a sense different
from the same request coming from a young girl. A
young girl must be very sure indeed that a man
would feel flattered by her invitation before she
asks him to call. It is usually safe to assume that,
if he does wish the acquaintance to go further than
chance meetings, he will find a way to make it
known to her, thus saving her the embarrassment
of taking the initiative.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE LENGTH OF A CALL</div>

<p>The time for making calls upon young women
varies in different parts of the country. In the
larger cities of the East the conventional time is
between four and seven o’clock in the afternoon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
In smaller towns of the East and in most southern
and western places, evening calls are the mode.
When the acquaintance between the young man and
the young woman in question is slight, a call of half
an hour is considered a proper length. When the
acquaintance has mellowed into friendship, the
length of the call is not prescribed. A sense of propriety
will suggest to both when it should come to
an end.</p>

<p>If a servant is in waiting when the caller arrives,
this domestic should take care of the young man’s
hat, coat and stick, or should designate where the
caller may place these things. If the young woman
herself should chance to open the door, she
must designate where he is “to rest his wraps,” as
the negroes say. She must not, on any account,
assist him in ridding himself of these articles, nor,
later, when he leaves, aid him in getting them together.
Nice but socially uninstructed girls lay
themselves open to severe criticism through exactly
such mistaken actions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If the call is a first call, the young man should
be presented to the girl’s mother, and if the girl
chooses, to other members of the family. In succeeding
calls, according to conventional usage in
America, it is merely a happen-so whether members
of the young woman’s family are present or not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>One can prescribe no rule as to what young men
and young women should talk about. The subjects
they may discuss are as numerous as the sands of
the sea, and depend upon taste, temperament and education.</p>

<p>As to manner, it is well to insist a little, in these
days of brusk camaraderie between the sexes, on
the fact that courtesy has many charming opportunities
of exhibition in the conversation between
men and women. There is a kind of deference that,
with no lack of frankness, should be cultivated in
the attitude of one sex to the other, a quality that
makes for agreeable friendship to a rare degree. If
one selects this rather than other agreeable qualities
of manner as one to be cultivated in the relation of
the sexes, it is because it is one so often neglected.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE USE OF FIRST NAMES</div>

<p>When a young woman and young man have
grown up in the same place and have known each
other from childhood, it is proper for them to call
each other by their first names, but with acquaintances
of maturer years, the occasions for the adoption
of this custom should be rare. Nothing is more
vulgar for a young woman than an easy and promiscuous
habit of addressing Tom, Dick and Harry
as such.</p>

<p>A girl should not accept an invitation from a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
young man before he has called and has been presented
to her mother. The invitation once accepted,
there are little courtesies which he may pay to her
on the occasion of the festivity for which he has
asked to accompany her. These courtesies he should
not neglect to offer, and she should be gracious in
accepting. He may assist her in putting on her
wraps. He may put on her overshoes if the weather
is damp and a maid be lacking for that purpose.
If an extra wrap is demanded he should carry it for
her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In going up-stairs, the girl precedes the man, but
in descending, he goes first. In the street a man who
is punctilious walks on the outside of the walk, but
this rule is less observed than it was formerly. Of
course, a man allows a girl to precede him through
any doorway. In leaving a street-car, however, he
gets off first in order that he may help her alight.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">A YOUNG WOMAN’S ESCORT</div>

<p>It is the duty of a young woman’s escort to be
looking after her pleasure and comfort in various
ways. If he takes her to a dance, he must see, if
possible, that her card is filled. If it is not filled,
he should sit out with her the unclaimed dances.
Ordinarily, a girl does not cross a ballroom unless
accompanied by her escort or her chaperon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">AT THE THEATER</div>

<p>If a man takes a girl to the theater he should
procure a program for her and should assist her
in the removal of her wraps. Whenever accidentally
or by arrangement, a man accompanies a woman
he should not permit her to carry a package, umbrella
or wrap, unless the latter be a light summer
wrap which she may prefer to retain. The various
opportunities offered men for small services, for
little gallantries of conduct, can not be registered
in detail. They are too many. It is sufficient to
say that young women should encourage men in
such amiable habits. Favors of the sort indicated
are without cost and yet beyond price. If accepted
graciously they react on manners to the advantage
of both sexes. They help to make of society the
pleasing spectacle which we imagine it to be in our
dreams.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Young women who are guests at a box party
should sit in the front seats with the men behind
them. The writer was witness during the current
year of a small-town box party straggling into a
city theater, where each girl was awkwardly ranged
alongside of her escort. The clumsy unsophisticated
air of the party, each Jack beside his Jill,
needs no comment.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A young girl should not grant a request for an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
interchange of letters with a young man without
consulting her mother. A young woman should remember
in writing to a young man that written
words are not like spoken ones and are far more
capable of misinterpretation. Though prudence is
not a generous quality, it is one to be observed in
all letter-writing but that arising out of the most
intimate relations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CLEVER NOTE</div>

<p>The subject of letter-writing suggests the miniature
accomplishment of note-writing. The art of
brief sprightly expression on paper is one that is
worth striving for. It is capable of yielding pleasure
in many of the relations of life, in none more
conspicuously than in the relation between young
men and young women. A military man of some
distinction was interviewing the lady principal of
a girls’ school with reference to placing his daughter
there. “What would you like to have her
taught?” said the principal. “Some history;” he
said meditatively, “an appreciation of good literature,
and the art of writing as agreeable a note as
her mother did before her.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A young woman should hesitate to isolate herself
from general society by accepting too great an
amount of attention from any one man unless she
intends to marry him. As long as she is in doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
on this head she has, prudery to the contrary, a
right to accept the usual attentions from those men
whom she likes. If she is so imprudent as to shut
herself off from general companionship before she
has reached a decision as to marriage and then decide
in the negative, she is likely to suffer for her
imprudence. By a ludicrous chance dependent upon
the relation of the sexes, the man in the case, if he
cares to reenter society, regains it much more easily
than she. He can go about and take up dropped
threads while she is waiting at home for callers who
do not arrive. He is welcomed back with enthusiasm
by the girls who thought him lost forever,
while her recent avoidance of general society is
counted against her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">BECOMING ENGAGED</div>

<p>When a young man finds his affections engaged
he should formally ask the girl’s father for her hand
and should state his financial condition. This rule
of an older civilization than ours is much ridiculed
in many sections of our country; and it is true that
there are instances where it would not apply, where,
for reasons, the young man should make his initial
plea to the girl herself. But, generally speaking,
the custom is to be commended. A young man may
well suppose that a girl’s father will have her best
interests at heart. If the young man is serious in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
desire for her happiness he will have the courage to
ask her of one of the two persons to whom she is
dearest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE IMPORTANCE OF CHAPERONS</div>

<p>The whole matter of acquaintance between young
men and young women is one of supreme importance
in that it may lead to results of supreme importance.
In view of this fact it is amazing that
parents and guardians so often leave this matter
to the action of chance, that they do not feel the
wisdom of exercising a guiding hand in the choice
of associates for the young people under their care.
We have a prejudice against the European custom
of social espionage over the young. But it is safe
to assume that if we had more of such espionage
sentimental disasters would not be so frequent as
they now are, and more true and lasting friendships
between young men and young women would be
formed. The older members of the household
should take a part in creating the social atmosphere
in which their children move. They should cultivate
the friendship and acquaintance of young people
so that they may be able the more easily and
wisely to exert an influence in the right direction.
Only the opinion and taste of the person most concerned
should be final and decisive in the matter
of personal relations, but persuasion and direction
are mighty forces to be employed. Especially should
parents of attractive young women make it their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
business to know something about the young men
who frequent the house. Said a father of five well-married
young women: “I made it a rule in my
daughters’ girlhood to allow no young man the entrée
to my house who was not eligible in the sense
of character and breeding.” It is true that youth
and age will not always agree on the qualities of
desirable companionship, and it is also true that in
these disagreements age is sometimes wrong and
youth is right; but this does not interfere with the
truth of the statement that maturity should give to
youth all the help possible in the frequently momentous
choice of friends, particularly of those belonging
to the opposite sex.</p>

<p>It is customary, shortly before a wedding, for a
girl to give a farewell luncheon to her intimate girl
friends, including her bridesmaids, and for a man
to entertain his ushers at a dinner or supper party.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is expected at parties that the gentlemen present
will attend on the ladies, in the old-fashioned
word “wait” on them. Yet at many such affairs
one sees the men congregated in the hall, eating their
salads and ices, while the women are ungallantly left
to themselves. Servants may supply them with refreshments
if the hostess has so planned, but the
attendance is required just the same.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WELL-BRED MAN</div>

<p>A well-bred man will not in general society make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
a marked distinction in the courtesy he shows to a
woman who is unusually attractive and her companion
who is less fortunate. He will ask the plainer
woman to dance and will see that she has ices,
and he may find, after all, some unexpected reward
in a quality of hidden charm beneath the unpromising
exterior. Generosity in social situations is a
severe test of character and for that reason it is seen
less often than one would wish. The man who joins
a woman sitting conspicuously alone and devotes
himself to her entertainment if for only a quarter
of an hour deserves all the warm unspoken gratitude
that is sure to be felt by the woman.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A girl should be careful not to mistake the merely
polite attentions of a man for the advances of a
lover. Men are afraid of such a girl because of
the embarrassments that ensue, while they feel
“safe” with a sensible one who can be friendly without
becoming sentimental and who does not view
every man she dances with as a possible husband.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">LUNCHING AT A CLUB</div>

<p>A woman who is invited by a man to take luncheon
with him at his club will find a side entrance
reserved for the use of ladies, and a parlor where
she may be joined by her escort.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A MAN’S LEAVE-TAKING</div>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>COEDUCATION SOCIALLY CONSIDERED</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE idea of coeducation is a peculiarly
American idea. Perhaps nowhere else in the
world do such large bodies of young men and young
women meet together for purposes of study and,
at the same time, enjoy together such social freedom
as is the case in the coeducational institutions
of the United States. One may question the wisdom
of the coeducational idea, but as to its popularity
there can be no doubt. Coeducation is not
only with us, but, if indications are correct, it has
come to stay.</p>

<p>Its opponents say that men and women do not
work together so well as apart, that the distraction
of sex in coeducational institutions is such as to
prevent both men and women from making the
highest intellectual effort in their power. The advocates
of the system contend that the contact of
the sexes in school is a source of improvement to
the manners of both, that it makes young men more
courteous and young women less sentimental. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
friends of the movement also say that men and
women are stimulated to their best endeavor by the
presence of the opposite sex; and that, as the masculine
and the feminine intellects differ, one being
complementary to the other, so men and women,
studying together, gain a rounded conception of
the subject in hand not possible otherwise.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE SOCIAL AMENITIES</div>

<p>This article is not concerned with the pros and
cons of the argument, only with the questions suggested
by the freedom and facility with which
young people meet one another in coeducational
schools. It is easy to say that the usual social conventions
should be observed, as of course they
should; but it is not hard to see that the somewhat
informal conditions under which young people
meet in these institutions, make a strict adherence
to the code a matter of difficulty. Eighteen is the
average age at which young people enter college.
They are scarcely men and women, yet they are
too old for schoolboy and girl pranks, in which,
however, they often feel tempted to indulge. Many
young men and young women start to college without
social experience. They may belong to good
families whose essential ideals of conduct are stanch
and fine, but to families in which hard work and
financial stress have crowded out the knowledge
and practise of social amenities. The youth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
the students concerned, the inexperience of many,
the variety in previous training and inheritance
make the question of social relations much more
complicated than it would be in the towns or cities
from which the various students come and where
each one belongs by custom and birth to a well-defined
circle of friends.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">FORMING FRIENDSHIPS</div>

<p>A golden piece of advice for those entering college,
though one not easy to follow, is: “Be slow
in forming your friendships.” The friendships
you make with the members of your own sex influence
decidedly your friendships with the other
and both should be entered into with deliberation.
Better be somewhat lonely in the beginning of college
life than precipitate relations with those whom
you may later come to distrust. Let a young
woman wait, take time to survey the situation
coolly and dispassionately, before she decides which
one, if any, of the Greek societies which solicit her
attention she will enter. Do not let her be carried
away by the “rushing,” the spreads, the flatteries,
the flowers that may be used to influence her decision.
She will be all the more valued by the sorority
that gets her if she holds off a little until
her own mind and judgment have rendered an
answer to invitation. And, in the same relative
situation, the same word of warning applies to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
young men. It is in place here to say in regard to
the Greek societies that the pleasure and profit derived
by the members from such membership
should not lead them to a selfish disregard of those
outside. The tendency to work only for one’s
fraternity or sorority and to find fellowship or
friendship nowhere else is recognized as a narrowing
influence in these organizations.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COLLEGE PRECEDENTS</div>

<p>Each college, coeducational or otherwise, has its
local etiquette that has risen out of its history.
Certain things can be done by seniors, for instance,
that would not be tolerated in freshmen; certain
other things that have no reference to the general
rules of society are barred because of a collegiate
caprice that has been transformed into law. With
this unwritten but binding etiquette the student
soon becomes acquainted. If he runs counter to it,
he is brought up sharply and made to realize the
penalty. The etiquette of common sense, which
should guide the relations between young men and
women, is of another sort and, owing to the exigencies
of the case, must largely be expressed by
negative admonitions. The first of these is, do not
feel that absence from home gives you privileges
to do what you would not do at home. The word
“lark” is an enticing one, but young men and young
women do not indulge in “larks” together without
paying up. Anything that involves secrecy in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
good times of young men and young women away
at school should be avoided.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">AVOID FAMILIARITY</div>

<p>The frequency with which young people of two
sexes meet one another in coeducational schools
leads them easily into the habit of calling each other
by their first names, and into the worse one of adopting
nicknames. The advice of <i>Punch</i> is in place.
Don’t. Friendship does not mean familiarity.
Indeed familiarity is its greatest foe. When a
young girl allows a young man to call her by her
first name, unless engaged to him, she cheapens
his regard for her by just so much.</p>

<p>It often happens that the dormitories or boarding-houses
where students live do not afford attractive
reception rooms. A young woman shrinks
from receiving calls from her young men acquaintances
in ugly surroundings and in a room filled perhaps
with uncongenial girls or those indifferent to
her. It is not improper, under these circumstances,
that she should see her men friends elsewhere,—at
the college library, at the house of some married
friend or in the course of a walk planned beforehand.
But it is in wretched taste for her to loiter
on the streets with a young man, to stop on corners
for talk, to walk back and forth repeatedly from
college to boarding-place in his company. Again
good sense says, “Don’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">EXCHANGE OF PHOTOGRAPHS</div>

<p>Exchanging photographs is regarded as one of
the special privileges of college life. It would be
interesting to know how large a per cent. of the income
made by photographers in the United States
comes from college students. The exchange of
photographs between young men and young women
in the same class in college is allowable. Such exchange
is, in a sense, official and impersonal, and
is warranted by that fact. When a young woman
bestows her photograph under such circumstances
she should write upon it the name of the college
and the date of the class. This will indicate clearly
that the giving is not a matter of sentiment. The
promiscuous exchange of photographs between
young men and young women at college is bad.
Only a brother or a lover or an old friend should
be the recipient of a young woman’s likeness.
There is something too intimate about such a gift
to make it an object of general distribution.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One more “Don’t” occurs to the writer as applicable
to the relations of young men and women
as fellow students. Don’t use the college slang or
jargon when you talk together. If it is impossible
to keep it altogether out of the talk, use as little of
it as possible. Men students may carry on conversation
through this medium and it is sometimes
very funny, but it was not intended for feminine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
purposes. It is disgusting to hear a young man
speak to a young woman in the terms he would use
in addressing his chum. On the other hand it is
the attempted mannishness of tone popular with
some women students that prejudices many worthy
people against coeducational schools. The use of
college slang outside the boundaries of college life
is bad form even for a man, and gives a provincial
tone to his talk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CLASS FESTIVITIES</div>

<p>The opportunities for special festivities are
many in coeducational life, and there is a strong
temptation to overdo on the social side. Class
dances and receptions, fraternity and sorority
parties, commencement gaieties offer frequent allurement.
A student, woman or man, should sift
out this matter of recreation in his own mind and
should determine how much pleasure of this kind
he can afford financially and without detriment to
his health or his class standing. Some social diversion
he needs. To develop on the mental side
only is a mistake. Too much diversion is a far
more serious mistake.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that, at the parties given
by students, there should be proper chaperonage.
This is particularly necessary in entertainments,
often quite elaborate in character, given in chapter
houses of the fraternities. The fact that young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
men are hosts to the young women on such occasions
makes it the more necessary that chaperons
should be numerous and not too vivacious in character.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE DEAN OF WOMEN</div>

<p>There should be in every coeducational school a
dean of women. The duties of such a position include
regulation, as far as possible, of social relations
between the young men and young women
of the institution as well as actual instruction, if
necessary, on the more important matters of social
etiquette. In this official, young girls of the institution
should find a friend to whom they may go
for advice on vexed questions. Where there is no
formal office of the kind named, the service indicated
may sometimes be rendered by women members
of the faculty. Some years ago, in a western
town, the Chair of English Literature was occupied
by a woman who took upon herself the burden
of improving the manners of the student body,
largely composed of sturdy young farmers and girls
from country towns. Once a year in the college
chapel, she gave a lecture on this subject in which
she stated plainly what she thought necessary for
the social improvement of the school. Many a
young man was helped over awkward places by her
advice; many a young woman saved from some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
escapade which she might have blushed later to own.
The value of such instruction is inestimable.</p>

<p>When opportunity offers for consultation with
such a guide and teacher, the uninstructed student
should avail himself of it. When such a privilege
is not procurable, one’s own sense of propriety, if
diligently sought for and obeyed, will often lead
one out of an awkward situation for which one
does not know the formal rule.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">HIGH-SCHOOL PARTIES</div>

<p>Many parents who intend to send their daughters
to women’s colleges allow them to take a preparatory
course in a coeducational high school. The
best high schools of that character now take the
very important precaution of hiring a dean, whose
duty it is especially to watch over the girl students.
High-school sororities and all secret organizations
are frowned on if not positively prohibited in these
schools, as it has been demonstrated that they interfere
with proper attention to studies and lead to
many undesirable relationships. Class hops and
receptions suitably chaperoned furnish sufficient diversion.
One hopes that one of the results of the
appointing of deans in the high schools will be a
change in the manner of dressing of many high-school
girls. It is too often both inartistic and in
bad taste. A schoolgirl should be dressed prettily,
but in a quiet and appropriate way.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>THE CHAPERON</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">IN some parts of America the chaperon is, like
Sairey Gamp’s interesting friend, “Mrs. Harris,”—a
mere figment of the imagination. Nowhere
in America does she occupy the perfectly defined position
that she holds in Europe; nowhere in America
are her duties so arduous as those imposed on her
in older countries. The idea that a chaperon for
young people is necessary on all occasions offends
the taste of the American. It is even opposed to
his code of good manners. That a young woman
should never be able in her father’s house to receive,
without a guardian, the young men of her acquaintance,
is alien to the average American’s ideal of
good breeding and of independence in friendship.
In addition, his sense of humor sets down constant
attendance on the very young as a bore and wearisome
in the extreme.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A young business or professional woman dispenses
with any protection except that afforded her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
by her work itself. Some years ago a young southern
woman, forced to earn her living, and who had
become a reporter in Washington, made herself
absurd by taking a duenna with her whenever she
went out to gather news. Perhaps it is unnecessary
to say that no girl can afford to call on a man at
his office except on an errand of business or charity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">DOING WITHOUT CHAPERONS</div>

<p>Because of these prejudices current concerning
the idea of chaperonage, because of this mode of
considering the subject, characteristically American,
it is all the more necessary that the line should be
sharply drawn as to the occasions where the consensus
of usage and good sense declares a chaperon
to be indispensable. The sense of the best American
conventionalities, broadly speaking, is that a
young woman may have greater liberty in her
father’s house than elsewhere. A young man who
frequents a house for the purpose of calling on a
young woman should be on terms with the members
of her family, but it is not taken for granted that
he must spend every minute of his visits in their
presence, or that the young woman should feel that
she is acting unconventionally in receiving his calls
by herself. It <i>is</i> unconventional, however, for her
to take with him long evening drives without a
chaperon, or to go on any sort of prolonged outdoor
excursion, be the party large or small, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
a chaperon. Driving parties, fishing parties,
country-club parties, sailing parties, picnics of every
kind,—here the chaperon is indispensable. No one
can tell what accidents or delays may occur at festivities
of this kind that might render a prolonged
absence embarrassing and awkward without the
chaperon.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE CHAPERON’S DUTIES</div>

<p>Any married woman may act as chaperon.
“Young and twenty” may chaperon “fat and forty”
if the former has the prefix “Mrs.” before her name
and the latter is still of the “Miss” period. It is
often very amusing to hear young matrons talk of
their experience in chaperoning their elders. The
office is one that the newly married woman likes to
assume both because of its privileges and because
it seems to emphasize her new dignities.</p>

<p>In consequence of the fact that the frivolous and
light-minded young married woman is quite as apt
to be called upon to fill the office of chaperon as
a person of more responsible qualities, the duties
of this position are often less considered than its
advantages. To some extent the duties and the
privileges melt together, but not entirely. When,
for instance, a bachelor, or a married man whose
wife is out of town, entertains young unmarried
people with a theater party and a supper afterward
at restaurant or club, and asks a married woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
of his acquaintance to act as chaperon, he expects
to pay her more attention and courtesy than he will
give to other guests, while at the same time expecting
from her an assumption of some of the duties
of hostess for the occasion. He may send her
flowers if he chooses. She must have the seat of
honor in the front of the box engaged at the theater
and, later, the seat of honor at the supper party.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CHAPERON’S PRIVILEGES</div>

<p>In return she must exercise her power of pleasing
generally and not for the benefit only of the two or
three of the party whom she likes best. Her surveillance
of the company is, of course, merely nominal.
It is taken for granted in civilized society
that young people will behave properly. A chaperon
is merely the official sign that the proprieties
are observed. She is not an instructress and is not
likely to be asked to fill the position of chaperon
more than once if she assumes to be. Her presence
prevents embarrassment and embarrassing situations.
It should also act upon the guests as an
amalgamating agent. At a party of the description
given, her business is to mix agreeably the different
elements of the company.</p>

<p>The duties and privileges of acting as chaperon,
in such circumstances, are of so pleasant a kind
that the office is a coveted one. Attractive women
are much more apt to be asked to fill the position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
than unattractive ones, except when a chaperon is
regarded simply as an offering on the altar of propriety.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the duties of a chaperon are
somewhat various, and more or less arduous, according
to the quality of those chaperoned. These
duties depend so largely upon circumstances that
they are not easily classified. It is, of course, the
part of the chaperon to smooth over awkward situations,
to arrange and make smooth the path of
pleasure. It is the duty of the chaperoned to agree
without demur to whatever the chaperon may suggest.
On any debatable point her decision must be
regarded as final.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHAPERONS AT A BALL</div>

<p>A personal and individual chaperon for every
young girl is not necessary at a ball. It is expedient,
however, that there should be some one present
who, on demand, can act in that capacity for
her,—some married woman with whom she may
sit out a dance, if she be not provided with a partner,
or whom she may consult in any of the small
difficulties possible to the occasion. If a young
woman attend a ball in company with her mother
or some other matron, she should return each time,
after a dance, to the seat occupied by her chaperon
and should direct her several partners to find her
there. In case she dances with any one unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
to her chaperon, it goes perhaps without saying that
the man in the case should be presented properly to
the friend in charge of her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The question as to whether a young man must
ask the services of a chaperon when he invites one
young woman to accompany him to the theater is
answered differently in different parts of the country.
In the East a man who asks a young woman
to go with him to the opera or the play, often invites
her mother or some feminine married friend
to accompany them. In the West this usage is not
so common. Those who do not observe it are not
regarded as outside the pale of good form.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">ON OUTDOOR EXCURSIONS</div>

<div class="sidenote">A DUTCH TREAT</div>

<p>In the case of outdoor excursions the chaperon
should fix the hour of departure to and from the
place of festivity; she should group the guests for
the journey there and back, and should designate
their positions at the table if a meal or refreshments
be served. The duty of the chaperoned, is, in return,
to make the position of chaperon as agreeable
as possible, to defer to her in every way. The
favor, in the case of chaperonage, is conferred by
the chaperon, though the actions of certain crude
young people are no recognition of this fact. A
case in point occurs to the writer where a young
man and his wife were asked to chaperon a party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
of young people to a popular rendezvous twelve or
fourteen miles from the city in which they lived.
The married people, after much urging, consented
with some reluctance, thereby sacrificing a cherished
plan of their own. Going and coming they were
asked to take the back seat, which they occupied by
themselves,—a seat over the wheels of the large
vehicle provided. During the country supper they
sat at one end of the table where their presence was
conversationally ignored. When the time came
for returning home the married man was approached
by one of the originators of the party,
who said that the affair was a “Dutch treat,” and
would he (the married man) please pay his share
of the bill. This is, of course, an extraordinary
case, but in a gross way it illustrates the lack of
consideration often incident to the relation between
chaperon and chaperoned. That the obligation to
the chaperon should be properly recognized is an
important part of social training.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>THE MATTER OF DRESS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">TO be comfortably and becomingly clothed is
an acknowledged aspiration of most women
and many men. The time to be ashamed of such
an aspiration is now happily gone by with some
other detrimental puritanical notions, and we cheerfully
give ourselves to the love of pretty things for
personal adornment as we do to beauty in other
directions. That too much time may be spent in
the thought about, and selection of, clothes is true,
also that extravagance of expenditure and other
vices are the price of such vanity. On the other
hand, it is as true, though not so directly and obviously
so, that a lack of attention to dress leads
equally to disaster. The badly-gowned woman is
apt to be self-conscious, not in possession of her
best self; and too often she carries the thought of
dress exactly to the place where her mind should
be free of such reflections. One should not wear
more than one can successfully “carry off.” Care
about the details of dress should be left behind when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
one goes visiting or appears anywhere in public.
If one’s toilet has been thought out and attended
to properly before leaving home, one’s mind is then
free for the entertainment of other subjects. If
this important matter is suggested to one only by
the unhappy contrast between one’s appearance and
that of the people about one, then unless one is
possessed of a particularly strong mind, the pleasure
of the occasion in question is nullified, the possible
profit to be derived from it is cut off.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GOSPEL OF GOOD GOWNS</div>

<p>Self-consciousness does away with the easy use
of one’s faculties and renders them stiff and unpliable.
Trim appropriate clothing has a tendency
to make the wearer happy and is an encouragement
to a comfortable and lively temper of mind. I remember
hearing a humorous old clergyman say
that he was frequently called upon to endure the
recital of her miseries from a very untidy woman
of his congregation and to prescribe advice therefor.
At last with him truth came to the surface,
and a thought that had long lain dormant in his
mind found expression on the final occasion of her
request for counsel from him. “Madam,” he said,
“I believe you would be a much happier woman if
you combed your hair becomingly and put on a
fresh gown oftener.” The matter of dress is at
once a serious and, to a beauty-loving temperament,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
a charming consideration. To some extent it has
to do with character and much to do with happiness.
Some moralists to the contrary notwithstanding,
the becomingness or the unbecomingness
of what one wears reacts upon the wearer and
makes her distrustful or confident, timid or courageous,
and this in a not unworthy sense.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If the subject of dress is important, the consideration
we give to it should be of a correspondingly
dignified and orderly character. There is a happy
medium between spending too much and too little
time on the thought of what we wear. At regular
periods, say at least twice a year, the matter should
be taken up with some care, the needs of one’s
wardrobe investigated, the amount of money at
one’s disposal for such purposes be determined
upon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IF THE PURSE IS SMALL</div>

<p>If one’s purse is so large that the question is
only one of purchase, of consulting good outfitters
and dressmakers, there is still room for neat and
methodical management. If one’s purse is small,
orderly and businesslike management is a necessity.
One should study one’s appearance and find out for
one’s self what colors, what tendencies in fashion
are becoming to one, and resolutely strike others
off the list. Reason, not fancy, nor altogether fashion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
should guide one in the choice of fabrics and
tints. One’s manner of life should be considered
in the selection of gowns, and the appropriate thing
picked out for the anticipated occasion. A train
on the street, velvet in the morning, no matter what
may seem to be worn by extremists, could never
be in taste. Veils that are so heavy as to seem disguises
or so ornamented that they give the wearer,
at a little distance, the appearance of having a skin
disease, should be left to the women who wish to
startle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE STREET GOWN</div>

<p>The most important gown to be taken into account
is the street gown, the garb in which one appears
every day and before the largest number of
people. That one should look well all the days of
the week is more important and convincing than
that one should look well for the particular and infrequent
occasion. If one must choose between a
good day-in-and-day-out gown and one of a more
elaborate and decorative description, the preference
should be given to the tailor or street gown. One
would better invest in a cloth costume of good material
and cut, and wear this unchanged through
more than one season than indulge in two or three
of cheaper mold that reflect unsteadily the passing
mode. This gown may serve not only for street
but, with various waists, may develop other uses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
than that of outdoor wear. The changes possible
in accessories will make it available for calls, teas,
afternoon receptions and the theater.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">BETWEEN SEASONS</div>

<p>Many women who dress fairly well in summer
and in winter, fail to provide themselves with suitable
attire for the intervening seasons. Spring finds
them with only a fur-trimmed cloak, and in early
fall they are still wearing thin midsummer frocks.
In our changeable climate, clothing of various
weights is absolutely necessary to make a good appearance.
All fur coats are seldom suitable, and
for this reason should be left for those who can buy
as many garments as they choose. Good separate
furs are a much wiser investment for a woman of
limited means. White kid gloves for marketing
and shopping, even if one can afford them, are out
of taste because out of place.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For a woman who goes to balls and dinners,
however infrequently, a good low-cut gown of
some description is indispensable. Women who
have lived quiet provincial lives and are called
upon to grace a wider social sphere are not always
aware of this. They provide themselves with appropriate
gowns of other descriptions, but they feel
afraid of the gown made especially for evening
wear. They have a foolish fear sometimes of trying,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
by this means, to look younger than they are
or of making themselves conspicuous in the wearing
of such a frock. Conspicuousness lies in the
other direction. Full dress is the proper wear for
metropolitan entertainments after six o’clock in the
evening, and full dress means a dress coat for a
man and a low-cut frock of appropriate material
for a woman. Avoidance of embarrassment means
the adoption of this conventional wear. A woman
who has reached an age when her neck has begun
to wither in front is not, however, an object of
beauty when décolleté. She will do well to wear a
jeweled collar or a band of velvet or tulle.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WHAT IS FULL DRESS</div>

<p>To the indispensable items just mentioned may
be added theater gowns, dinner gowns, ball gowns,
outing costumes, tea gowns, negligees,—a bewildering
variety of attire suited not only to every feminine
need but answering to every feminine caprice.
Few words are necessary to those women whose
purse is equal to the purchase of all the feminine
fripperies dear to a woman’s heart. Dealers and
experienced modistes are always at hand to offer
serviceable advice to those who have the wherewithal
to pay for it, though one should not take,
without weighing it, even the best advice of this sort.
Try to be intelligent about your clothes and to show
a little individuality. Only this bit of counsel is
perhaps in season to those who may have measurably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
what they choose in the way of wearing apparel.
Preserve some sort of equality between the
different items of your toilet. Do not have a splendid
theater gown and a shabby negligee. Do not
wear fine furs over an inferior street gown. Do
not wear heavy street boots with a velvet evening
gown. Arrange the articles of your wardrobe so
that they bear some sort of happy relation to one
another, so that one article may not be ashamed to
be found in the company of any other, so that your
clothes may seem to be the harmonious possession
of one person, not the happen-so belongings of a
half-dozen varying temperaments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GOWN AND ITS WEARER</div>

<p>There are persons,—we all know them,—whose
happy attire is always calling forth
some such remark as,—“That looks precisely like
her,” or “She and the gown were made for
each other.” This sort of relation between
person and wardrobe is the most charming outcome
possible to the consideration of personal
adornment. It gives dignity and distinct esthetic
value to the subject of clothes. Let us have no more
red on blondes, and let over-stout women leave
plaids and checks alone. Thin girls should wear
frills and leave plain-tailored clothes to plumpness.
With the woman of means, this harmony need not
be, though it often is, occasional. It may be constant
and if she is a person of esthetic temperament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
she may gain from this happy relation between herself
and her clothes a soul-satisfying sense of bliss
not to be gained from any other source in the world.
Over-dressing is, of course, avoided by women of
taste.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">IMPORTANCE OF ACCESSORIES</div>

<p>Many women who have little to spend put nearly
the lump sum into gowns. This is a mistake of the
gravest sort. The effect of the prettiest gown may
be spoiled by an ill-fitting corset, by gloves that are
no longer fresh and by shoes that are not trim and
suitable to the occasion. White gloves should be
white, and white shoes likewise, or they should not
be worn. The proper accessories of dress, among
which are veils, belts, ruchings and collars, often
give to an otherwise plain costume, the effect of
something chic and telling.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">HOW TO PUT ON A HAT</div>

<p>Becoming head-gear is of the utmost importance.
“A hat,” said an apt society woman of the writer’s
acquaintance, “should bear the same relation to
other parts of one’s costume that the title of a story
does to the story itself. This article of dress should
be at once the key and the consummation of the effect
intended.” The fashion in hats varies with
great rapidity from year to year, and one should be
careful to avoid the extremes of style. Only a face
of great beauty can stand the precipitous, fantastic
slants and curves that mark the ultra fashionable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
in millinery. If one is so fortunate as to find sometime
a shape that is decidedly becoming, one should
follow through life its general outline with modifications
sufficient to conform in a general way to
passing modes. Form the habit of putting your
hats on from the back, thus pushing the loose hair
about the face slightly forward. The plainest face
is softened and beautified by a fluffy arrangement
of the hair about the temple. Nothing is more fatal
to good looks than a high bald forehead. Many
women make a fatal mistake in their preference for
big hats. The picture-hat is only suited to the large
and picturesque type. Large hats make little women
look like mushrooms, and frequently they take away
all distinction and individuality from the face beneath.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Many a charming costume is spoiled by a failure
to realize that the feet must be dressed in harmony
with the rest of the costume. Too many women,
otherwise attractive in appearance, wear shoes with
scuffed toes and run-down heels, the latter due to
a bad habit of turning the foot over in walking.
This can be corrected easily by having the shoe built
up at the sole on the opposite side by the insertion
of a piece of thick leather, which any shoe-mender
will do very cheaply. One is then forced to use the
foot properly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">CHOICE IN JEWELS</div>

<p>Women otherwise tasteful in dress are often
careless and unthoughtful in the jewels they wear.
In gowns and millinery they would not think of
wearing colors that clash and fight, yet they do not
establish a correspondence between clothes and
jewels worn, between trinkets and the quality of
personal appearance. They wear the contents of
their jewel-boxes irrespective of suitability, indifferent
as to season of night or day. A profusion
of jewels, or the wearing of various and hostile
stones at one time, is to be avoided as the pestilence.
A jewel, like a fine picture, needs background, space
to show it off. In the company of many other jewels
it loses identity and distinction, and fails in conferring
these qualities upon the wearer. In choosing
precious stones it is a good rule to establish
some sort of relation between their color and the
eyes of the wearer. Turquoise intensifies the hue
of blue eyes, topaz that of brown ones, and emeralds
are particularly becoming to women whose
eyes have a greenish tinge.</p>

<p>Color is so important an element of success in
every department of dress that its study should be
a part of the education of every woman who wishes
to be well gowned. The correspondence between
the color of the gown and the appearance of the
person who is to wear it is of more importance than
the quality of the texture employed. Hue and fit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
make for becomingness to a greater extent than
elegance in material, though the latter is also an
element of beauty in an all-round conception of the
subject. A feeling for textures is rare, but it may
be cultivated, and the effort to do this is worth
making.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INDIVIDUALITY IN DRESS</div>

<p>Some women who are timid as to their ability to
combine colors and tones, plunge into black as a
safe refuge or adopt a standard color which they
regard as “safe” for all occasions. This is a poor
way out of the difficulty. Resolute study and a little
experimenting will yield better results and an
agreeable variety. A woman should study her
“points” in the light of day before a full-length
mirror, and once she has really learned what becomes
her she should allow no milliner or modiste
to coax her into “the latest cry.” There is no such
thing as the “tyranny of fashion” for the woman
who dresses intelligently. She will never be either
in or out of the mode.</p>

<p>Neatness is unquestionably an element of that
indefinable thing we call style, though many women
who are neat are not modish. Neatness is the integrity
of dress, the essential foundation to which
all good things may be added. To a woman whose
love for dress is allied to the thirst for perfection
in that branch, untidiness is more than distasteful.
If “extra” hair must be worn, it should be moderate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
in quantity, of the best quality and most skilfully
arranged. Face powder, carelessly put on,
makes a woman look ridiculous. An open placket
is viewed by a fastidious woman as something like
disgrace. Broken shoe-laces, gaps between belt and
skirt, soiled neckwear, crookedness in the arrangement
of gowns and other evidences of careless
dressing are abhorrent to her. Neatness, freshness
and suitability in the wardrobe are more important
items than elaboration and cost. The person who
suggests these desirable qualities in the manner of
her attire, whether she has a large or a small
amount of money to be expended in clothes, is sure
to present an agreeable appearance. If to these
qualities she adds a scent for novelty and style, she
may hope to be, as far as clothes are concerned,
“very smart indeed.” If beyond this she have the
artist’s gift, she may make herself better than
“smart,” she may be beautiful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MINOR POINTS IN DRESS</div>

<p>One minor point: the handkerchief, when not in
actual use, should be invisible. It is a concession to
nature, and to carry it in the hand, tuck it in the
belt or up the sleeve is provincial. A muff or a
party bag of dainty texture may serve to hide it in
lieu of a pocket.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">HAPHAZARD DRESSING</div>

<p>At women’s parties in this country one sees a
variety of costumes not all suited to the occasion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
The hostess at a luncheon may wear a white lingerie
dress, one of her guests will be in a shirt-waist costume,
a second in white satin and the rest in quiet
silks or in elegant chiffon waists and cloth or velvet
skirts. The picture is spoiled by this haphazard
dressing. The majority were correctly attired but
the shirt-waist and the white satin were equally
wrong. The hostess who knows that any one of her
guests may be compelled to dress with exceptional
plainness will help to make that person comfortable
by wearing a quiet gown herself. Except at very
intimate affairs it is wiser, however, to decline an
invitation than to make an embarrassingly poor appearance.</p>

<p>At afternoon receptions one often sees the hostess
and her assistants in elaborate gowns, while
many of the callers are in tailored street costume.
This again spoils the picture. If a woman expects
to attend afternoon affairs she should have an afternoon
gown.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Highly polished finger-nails of a length to suggest
claws, are bad form though one sees them on
women who ought to know better. The nails should
be carefully filed—not trimmed—to a shape only
slightly pointed, they should show the pretty half-moon
at the base and may bear a slight polish but
no artificial coloring. To keep the half-moon plainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
visible, gently push back the scarf-skin at the
base of the nail daily with an orange-wood stick.
A little cold cream rubbed in nightly around the
edges of the nails is a great help. No sharp instrument
should ever be used to clean the nails. The
orange-wood sticks are best adapted to this purpose.
Peroxide will remove stains.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">A WORD ON GLOVES</div>

<p>Suède gloves are softer in appearance and more
elegant than the glacé ones, but as they soil more
quickly and clean less readily they should not be
attempted by women of limited means. A delicately
colored glove is more artistic with many costumes
than a pure white one, but here again practicability
must be counted, as the light-colored glove will seldom
clean well and the white one does. A woman
who must carefully consider the cost of her dressing
will, if she is clever, plan mezzo-tinted costumes
which are artistic and becoming and which do not
demand light or white gloves.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Transparent blouses that display the under-clothing
are bad form. If very sheer material is used,
a special slip should be worn under the blouse. Very
thin hose are equally objectionable. Perfume of
any sort is now taboo beyond the elusive scent of
lavender or violet sachets in one’s dresser drawers,
or a dash of toilet water in the bath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">DRESSING FOR CHURCH</div>

<p>One’s dress at church should invariably be quiet.
This is prescribed not only by taste but by consideration
for others who may be present and who may
be of more limited means. A church is of all places
the one in which to avoid exciting envy by costly
apparel.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One of the mistaken ideas held by women who
are just becoming sensitive to effects in dress is that
everything should match. The result in such cases
if not positively bad is usually dull and monotonous.
The woman who wears with her blue suit a
blue hat with a blue feather and a blue veil, a blue
waist and blue gloves and shoes, is a nightmare. A
black hat, an écru veil, gray gloves perhaps—in these
ways relief and variety must be obtained. In choosing
colors, the skin, hair and eyes should all be considered.
It is an exploded idea that brunettes should
cling to brown. Much depends on the complexion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>MAKING AND RECEIVING GIFTS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">WEDDING gifts may be sent any time after
the wedding cards are issued. They are
sent to the bride, and may be as expensive and elaborate,
or as simple and inexpensive, as the means
of the sender make proper. An invitation to a
church wedding, and not to the reception, precludes
the necessity of making a wedding-present. Indeed
the matter of wedding-presents admits of more freedom
each year and many people make it a rule to
send gifts only to intimate friends and relatives. Perhaps
this state of affairs has been brought about by
the fact that among a certain—or uncertain—class,
invitations were sometimes issued with the
special purpose of calling forth a number of presents,—in
fact, for revenue only. Few persons acknowledge
this of themselves, but sometimes a bride was
met who was so indiscreet or so void of taste as to
confess her hope that all the persons whom she invited
to her nuptials would be represented by remembrances
in gold, silver, jewelry or napery. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
pendulum has swung as far in the opposite direction,
and fewer wedding gifts than of old are sent
from politeness alone.</p>

<p>Suitable gifts for a bride are silver, cut-glass,
table linen, pictures, books, handsome chairs or tables,
rugs, bric-à-brac and jewelry. In fact, anything
for the new home is proper. It is not customary
to send wearing apparel, except when this
is given by some member of the bride’s family. A
check made out to the bride is always a handsome
gift. The parents of the wife-to-be frequently give
the small silver.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">MARKING THE SILVER</div>

<p>How should the silver be marked? is sometimes
asked. Good form demands that if the donor
wishes to have his gift marked, it must be engraved
with the bride’s maiden initials. Some persons are
so thoughtful that they send silver with the request
that it be returned after the ceremony by the bride
for marking as she sees fit. She then returns it to
the firm from which it was bought,—said firm having
received an order from the donor to engrave
it according to the owner’s wishes.</p>

<p>Still, if silver must be given marked, it is safe
to have the initials of the bride put upon it. Even
should she die, good taste and conventionality would
forbid the use of her silver by the second wife,—should
there be one. While on this melancholy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
side of the subject it would be well to state that
when a wife dies, leaving a child, and the husband
remarries, her silver is packed away for the child’s
use in future years. This is demanded by custom
and conventionality. This rule is especially to be
regarded if the child be a girl, as she then has
a right to the mother’s silver, marked with that
mother’s name.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">ACKNOWLEDGING GIFTS</div>

<p>A wedding gift is accompanied by the donor’s
card,—usually enclosed in a small card-envelope.
As soon as possible, the bride-to-be writes a personal
letter of thanks. This must be cordial, and
in the first person, somewhat in this form:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“425 Cedar Terrace, Milton, Pa.<br />
</p>

<p class="unindent">“My Dear Mrs. Hamilton:</p>

<p>“The beautiful picture sent by Mr. Hamilton and
yourself has just arrived, and I hasten to thank you
for your kind thought of me. The subject is one
of which I am especially fond, and the picture will
do much toward making attractive the walls of our
little home. It will always serve to remind Mr.
Allen and myself of you and Mr. Hamilton.</p>

<p class="sig">
<span style="margin-right: 4em;">“Gratefully yours,</span><br />
“Mary Brown.<br />
</p>

<p>“June nineteenth, nineteen hundred and five.”</p></div>

<p>If a gift arrives so late that it can not be acknowledged
before the wedding, the wife must write<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
as soon as possible after the ceremony,—even during
the first days of her honeymoon. To neglect
to do this is an unpardonable rudeness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The wedding gifts may be displayed in a room
by themselves on the wedding-day, but must not
be accompanied by the cards of the donors. In
spite of arguments pro and con, it is certainly in
better taste to remove the cards before the exhibition.
If there are so many present that there is
any danger of the bride’s forgetting from whom
the different articles came, let some member of the
family keep a list, or take an inventory, before
the cards are taken off. Some persons attach to
each gift a tiny slip of paper bearing a number.
In a little book is a corresponding number after
which is written the name of the sender.</p>

<p>The rules that apply to wedding-presents apply
also to the gifts sent at wedding anniversaries, be
they wooden, tin, crystal, silver or golden anniversaries.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">ENGAGEMENT GIFTS</div>

<p>Engagement presents are frequently sent to the
fiancée, but this is entirely a matter of taste or
inclination, and is not demanded by fashion or conventionality.
Contributions to linen showers may
be included among the engagement gifts. The fashion
of such “showers” is ephemeral,—a fact not
to be regretted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">WHAT A MAN MAY GIVE</div>

<p>A word or more is not out of place concerning
the kind of gifts that a young man may make with
propriety to a young woman with whom he is on
agreeable terms. Flowers, books, candy,—these are
gifts that he may make without offense, and she
may receive without undue or unpleasant sense of
obligation. If he be an old and intimate friend
of her family, he may offer her small trinkets, or
ornamental, semi-useful articles, such as a card-case,
or a bonbonnière. Anything intended solely
for use is proscribed. If a young man is engaged
to a young woman the possible choice of gifts is,
of course, much enlarged. Even then, however,
very expensive gifts are not desirable. They lessen
somewhat the charm of the relation between
the two.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When a baby is born, the friends of the happy
mother send her some article for the new arrival.
It may be a dainty dress or flannel skirt, a cloak,
cap or tiny bit of jewelry. These gifts the young
mother is not supposed to acknowledge until she
is strong enough to write letters without fear of
weariness. As a rule some member of her family
writes in her stead, expressing the mother’s thanks.</p>

<p>When a baby is christened, it is customary for
the sponsors to make the little one a present. This
is usually a piece of silver,—as a cup, a bowl,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
marked with the child’s name; or a silver spoon,
knife and fork may be given. The godparents give
as a rule, something that will prove durable, or
a gift that the child may keep all his life, rather
than an article of wearing apparel.</p>

<p>A guest invited to a christening party may bring
a gift, if he wishes to do so. This may be anything
that fancy dictates. A pretty present for such an
occasion is a “Record” or “Baby’s Biography,”
handsomely bound and illustrated, containing blanks
for the little one’s weight at birth and each succeeding
year, for the record of his first tooth, the
first word uttered, the first step taken, and so on,
as well as spaces for the insertion of a lock of the
baby-hair, progressive photographs, and other trifles
dear to the mother’s heart. All christening gifts
may be orally acknowledged by the mother when
the guest presents them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">CHRISTMAS GIFTS</div>

<p>The custom of making Christmas presents is so
universal that it would seem superfluous to offer
any suggestion with regard to them, had not the
dear old custom been so abused that the lovers of
Christmas must utter their protest. It should be
borne in mind that the only thing that makes a
Christmas gift worth while is the thought that accompanies
it. When it is given because policy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
habit or conventionality demands it, it is a desecration.
If we must make any presents from a
sense of duty, let it be on birthdays, on wedding-days,
on other anniversaries,—never on the anniversary
of the Great Gift to the World. If the
spirit of good will to man does not prompt the
giving, that giving is in vain. Nor should a present
at this time be sent simply because one expects to
receive a reminder in the shape of a present from
a friend. A quid pro quo is not a true Christmas
remembrance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TO PREVENT DUPLICATION</div>

<p>Let us suppose then, that the making of holiday
presents is a pleasure. To simplify matters we
would suggest that those who have a large circle
of friends to whom they rejoice to give presents
retain over to another year the list made the year
previous. Not only will this keep in mind the person
whom they would remember, but it will prevent
duplicating presents. One woman learned to her
dismay that for two years she had sent the same
picture—a favorite with her—to a dear friend,
while another sent a friend silver button-hooks for
three consecutive Christmases.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">SINCERE GRATITUDE</div>

<p>All gifts, those of the holiday season included,
should be promptly acknowledged, and never by a
card marked “Thanks.” If a present is worth any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
acknowledgment, it is worth courteous notice.
When one says “Thank you!” either verbally or
by letter, it should be uttered with sincerity, and
from the heart. To omit the expression of cordial
gratitude is a breach of good breeding.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>BACHELOR HOSPITALITY</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE day is past when the bachelor is supposed
to have no home, no mode of entertaining his
friends, no lares and penates, and no “ain fireside.”
He is now an independent householder, keeping
house if he choose to do so, with a corps of
efficient servants, presided over by a competent
housekeeper,—or, in a simpler manner having a
small apartment of his own, attended by a manservant
or maid, if he takes his meals in his apartment.
Oftener, however, he prefers to dispense
with housekeeping cares and live in a tiny apartment
of two or three rooms, going out to a restaurant
for his meals. He is then the most independent
of creatures. If he can afford to have
a man to take care of his rooms and his clothes,
well and good. If not, he pays a woman to come
in regularly to clean his apartment, and she takes
charge of his bed-making and dusting or,—if he
be very deft, systematic and industrious,—he does
this kind of thing himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BACHELOR’S TEA</div>

<p>In any of the cases just cited he is at liberty to
entertain. He may have an afternoon tea, or a
reception, or an after-theater chafing-dish supper.
Unless he has his own suite of dining-room, kitchen
and butler’s pantry, he can not serve a regular meal
in his rooms. But there are many informal, Bohemian
affairs to which he can invite his friends.
For the after-theater supper, for instance, he may
engage a man to assist him and to have everything
in readiness when the host and his party arrive
at the apartment. The host, himself, will prepare
the chafing-dish dainty, and with this may be passed
articles supplied by a near-by caterer, such as sandwiches,
ices and cakes. He may make his own
coffee in a Vienna coffee-pot. The whole proceeding
is delightful, informal and Bohemian in the
best sense of the word.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A sine qua non to all bachelor entertaining is a
chaperon. The married woman can not be dispensed
with on such occasions. The host may be
gray-headed and old enough to be a grandfather
many times over, but, as an unmarried man, he
<i>must</i> have a chaperon for his women guests. If
he object to this, he must reconcile himself to entertaining
only those of his own sex.</p>

<p>The age of this essential appendage to the social
party makes no difference, so long as the prefix<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
“Mrs.” is attached to her name. She may be a
bride of only a few weeks’ standing,—but the fact
that she is married is the essential.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENGAGING THE CHAPERON</div>

<p>The host, then, first of all, engages his chaperon,—asking
her as a favor to assist him in his hospitable
efforts. She should accept graciously, but
the man will show by his manner that he is honored
by her undertaking this office for him. She
must be promptly at his rooms at the hour mentioned,
as it would be the height of impropriety
for one of the young women to arrive there before
the matron. If she prefer she may accompany a
bevy of the girls invited. To her the host defers,
from her he asks advice, and to her he pays special
deference. If there is tea to be poured, as at an
afternoon function, it is she who is asked to do
it, and she may, with a pretty air of assuming responsibility,
manage affairs somewhat as if in her
own home, still remembering that she is a guest.
In this matter tact and a knowledge of the
ways of the world play a large part. The
chaperon is bound to remain until the last girl
takes her departure, after which it is quite <i>en règle</i>
for the host to offer his escort, unless she accompanies
the last guest, or a carriage be awaiting her.
The host thanks her cordially for her kind offices,
and she in turn expresses herself as honored by
the compliment he has paid her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">INVITING THE GUESTS</div>

<p>Perhaps the simplest form of entertainment for
the unmarried man to give in his own quarters
is the afternoon tea in some of its various forms.
For this function the man must not issue cards,
but must write personal notes, or ask his guests
orally. He may invite several friends who will
supply music. If he have some friend who is
especially gifted musically, and whom he would
gladly bring before the eyes of the public, he may
make the presence of this friend an excellent reason
for this afternoon reception. After having
secured the chaperon’s acceptance he may write
some such note as the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My dear Miss Brown:</p>

<p>“I shall be delighted if you, with a few other
choice spirits, will take tea with me in my apartment
next Tuesday afternoon about four o’clock. I shall
have with me at that time my friend, Mr. Frank
Merrill, who sings, I think, passing well. I want my
friends who appreciate music and to whom his voice
will give pleasure to hear him in my rooms at the
time mentioned. Do come!</p>

<p class="sig">
“Henry Barbour.<br />
</p>

<p>“August the tenth, 1905.”</p></div>

<p>There should, if possible, be a maid, or a man
in livery to attend the door, but, if this is not
practicable, and the affair be very informal, the
host may himself admit his guests, and escort them
to the door when they leave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">SERVING THE REFRESHMENTS</div>

<p>The only refreshments necessary are thin bread
and butter, and some dainty sandwiches, small cakes
and tea with sugar, cream and thin slices of lemon.
These things are arranged upon a prettily set table
in one corner of the room, and are presided over
by the chaperon, who also, when the opportunity
affords, moves about among the guests, chatting to
each and all as if she were in her own drawing-room.
If the man has several rooms, one may
be opened as a dressing-room in which the women
may lay their wraps. The men guests may leave
their coats and hats on the hall table or rack.</p>

<p>When the guests depart it is pretty and deferential
for the host to thank the women for making
his apartment bright and attractive for the afternoon.
It is always well for a man to show by his
manner that his woman guest has honored him by
her presence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An evening reception may be conducted in a
similar way, but at this time coffee and chocolate
take the place of tea. Or, if the host prefer, he
may serve only cake and coffee, or punch, or ices
in addition to the cake and coffee.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If a bachelor be also a householder to the extent
of running a regular ménage, he may give
a dinner in his home just as a woman might. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
first engages his chaperon, then invites his guests.
The chaperon is the guest of honor, is taken out
to dinner by the host and sits at his right. It is
also her place to make the move for the women
to leave the men to their cigars and coffee, and
proceed to the drawing-room. Here, after a very
few minutes, the women are joined by the men
or, at all events, by the host, who may, if he like,
give his men guests permission to linger in the
dining-room a little longer than he does. They
will, however, not take long advantage of this permission,
but, at the expiration of five or ten minutes,
will follow their host to the drawing-room.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE RESTAURANT SUPPER</div>

<p>The man who can not entertain in his own rooms
may return any hospitality shown to him by giving
a supper or dinner at a restaurant or hotel. In
this case he must still have a chaperon,—if the
party is to be made up of unmarried persons. For
such an affair as this he engages his table and
orders the dinner beforehand, seeing for himself
that the flowers and decorations chosen are just
what he wishes. It is his place to escort the chaperon
to the restaurant and to seat her at his right.
Everything is so perfectly conducted at well-regulated
restaurants that the course of the dinner will
progress without the host’s concerning himself about
it. If, however, the host wishes to give an order,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
he should beckon to a waiter, and in a low tone
make the necessary suggestion or give the requisite
order. It is, at such a juncture, the part of
the chaperon to keep the conversational ball rolling,—in
short, to act as if she were hostess.</p>

<p>The dinner over, the host escorts his guests as
far as the door of the restaurant, going to the
various carriages with the women, then calls up
the chaperon’s carriage and, himself, accompanies
her to her home.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE BACHELOR DINNER</div>

<p>At a bachelor dinner the host may provide corsage
bouquets for the ladies and boutonnières for
the men. It is also a pretty compliment for him
to send to the chaperon at his afternoon or evening
reception, flowers for her to wear. But this
is not essential, and is a compliment that may be
dispensed with in the case of a man who must
consider the small economies of life.</p>

<p>Of course, no dinner call is made on the bachelor
entertainer. It is hardly worth while to suggest
that the women whom he has honored make a point
of soon inviting him to their homes. In this day
there is little need to remind women of the attentions
they may with propriety pay to an eligible
and unattached man.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>THE VISITOR</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">AN invitation to visit a friend in her home must
always be answered promptly. The invited
person should think seriously before accepting such
an invitation, and, unfortunately, one of the things
she has to consider is her wardrobe. If the hostess
has a superb house, and the guest is to be one of
many, all wealthy except herself, all handsomely
gowned except herself, and if she will feel like an
English sparrow in a flock of birds of paradise,
she would better acknowledge the invitation, with
gratitude, and stay at home. If she does go, let
her determine to make no apologies for her appearance,
but to accommodate herself to the ways of
the household she visits.</p>

<p>One woman, visiting in a handsome home, was
distressed to the point of weeping by the fact that,
on her arrival, her hostess’ maid came to the guest’s
room and unpacked her trunk for her, putting the
contents in bureau-drawers and wardrobe. It would
have been better form if the visitor had taken what
seemed to her an innovation as a matter of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and expressed neither chagrin nor distress at the
kindly-meant and customary attention.</p>

<p>If, then, our invited person, after taking all things
into consideration, decides to accept the invitation
sent her, let her state just when she is coming, and
go at that time. Of course she will make her plans
agree with those of her future hostess. The exact
train should be named, and the schedule set must
not be deviated from.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It may be said right here that no one should make
a visit uninvited. Few persons would do this,—but
some few have been guilty of this breach of etiquette.
One need not always wait for an invitation
from an intimate friend, nor member of one’s family
with whom one can never be de trop, but, even then,
one should, by telegram or telephone, give notice of
one’s coming. If I could, I would make a rule that
no one should pay an unexpected visit of several
days’ duration. If one must go uninvited, one
should give the prospective hosts ample notice of
the intended visit, begging, at the same time, that
one may be notified if the suggested plan be inconvenient.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">BE PROMPT AND DEFINITE</div>

<p>When a letter of invitation is accepted, the acceptance
must not only be prompt, but must clearly
state how long one intends to stay. It is embarrassing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
to a hostess not to know whether her guest
means to remain a few days or many. As will be
seen in the chapter on “The Visited,” the hostess
can do much to obviate this uncertainty by asking
a friend for a visit of a specified length. But, in
accepting, the guest must also say how long she will
remain.</p>

<p>An invitation should be received gratefully. In
few things does breeding show more than in the
manner of acknowledging an invitation to a friend’s
house. She who asks another to be a member of
her household for even a short time is paying the
person asked the greatest honor it is in her power
to confer, and it should be appreciated by the recipient.
He who does not appreciate the honor implied
in such an invitation is unmannerly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">ALWAYS ARRIVE ON TIME</div>

<p>An invitation once accepted, nothing but such a
serious contingency as illness must prevent one’s fulfilling
the engagement. One must never arrive
ahead of time. Once in the home of a friend the
guest makes herself as much a member of the household
as possible. The hours of meals must be ascertained,
and promptness in everything be the rule.
To lie in bed after one is called, and to appear at
the breakfast table at one’s own sweet will, is often
an inconvenience to the hostess, and the cause of
vexation and discontent on the part of the servants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
for which discontent the hostess—not the guest—pays
the penalty. Unless, then, the latter is told
expressly that the hour at which she descends to the
first meal of the day is truly of no consequence in
the household, she must come into the breakfast-room
at the hour named by the mistress of the
house.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DUTIES OF A GUEST</div>

<p>On the other hand, one should not come down a
half-hour before breakfast and sit in the drawing-room
or library, thus keeping the maid or hostess
from dusting these rooms and setting them to rights.
The considerate guest will stay in her own room until
breakfast is announced, then descend immediately.
If the weather is fair, she may, of course, walk in
the grounds close to the house.</p>

<p>If amusements have been planned for the guest,
she will do her best to enjoy them, or, at all events,
to show gratitude for the kind intentions in her behalf.
She must resolve to evince an interest in all
that is done, and, if she can not join in the amusement,
give evidence of an appreciation of the efforts
that have been made to entertain. The guest must
remember that the hosts are doing their best to
please her, and that out of ordinary humanity, if
not civility, gratitude should be shown and expressed
for these endeavors.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If the hostess be a busy housewife, who has many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
duties about the house which she must perform herself,
the visitor may occasionally try to “lend a
hand” by dusting her own room or making her own
bed. If, however, she is discovered at these tasks,
and observes that the hostess looks worried, or objects
to the guest thus exerting herself, it is the
truest courtesy not to repeat the efforts to be of assistance.
It disturbs some housewives to know that
a visitor is performing any household tasks.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is safe to say that a guest should go home at
the time set unless the hostess urges her to do otherwise,
or has some excellent reason for wishing her
to change her plans. To remain beyond the time
expected is a great mistake, unless one knows that
it will be a genuine convenience to the hosts to have
one stay. The old saying that a guest should not
make a host twice glad has sound common sense as
its basis. If a visitor is persuaded to extend her
visit, it must be only for a short time, and she must
herself set the limit of this stay, at which time nothing
must in any way be allowed to deter her from
taking her departure.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE NECESSITY FOR TACT</div>

<p>The visitor in a family must exercise tact in many
ways. Above all she must avoid any participation
in little discussions between persons in the family.
If the father takes one side of an argument, the
mother the other, the wise guest will keep silent, unless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
one or the other appeal to her for confirmation
of his or her assertions,—in which case she should
smilingly say that she would rather not express an
opinion, or laugh the matter off in such a way as
to change the current of the conversation.</p>

<p>Another thing that a guest must avoid is reproving
the children of the house in even the mildest,
gentlest way. She must also resist the impulse to
make an audible excuse for a child when he is
reprimanded in her presence. To do either of these
things is a breach of etiquette.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE WEEK-END PARTY</div>

<p>If she be so fortunate as to be invited to a house-party
or a week-end party, she should accept or decline
at once, that the hostess may know for how
many people to provide rooms. For such an affair
one should take handsome gowns, as a good deal of
festivity and dress is customary among the jolly
group thus brought together. A dinner or evening
gown is essential, and if, as is customary, the house-party
be given at a country-home, the visitor must
have a short walking-skirt and walking-boots, as
well as a carriage costume.</p>

<p>Once a member of a house-party, the rule is simple
enough. Do as the others do, and enter with a will
on all the entertainment provided by the host and
hostess for the party.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE QUESTION OF TIPS</div>

<p>If you make a visit of any length you must not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
fail, if you are conventional, to leave a little money
for each servant who has, by her services in any
capacity, contributed to your comfort. This will,
of course, include the maid who has cared for the
bedroom, and the waitress. By one of these servants
send something to the cook, and a message of
thanks for the good things which she has made and
you have enjoyed. The laundress need not be inevitably
remembered, unless she has done a little
washing for you; still, when one considers the extra
bed and table linen to be washed, it is as well to
leave a half dollar for her also. The amount of
such fees must be determined by the length of one’s
purse; and must never be so large as to appear lavish
and unnecessary. A dollar, if you can afford it and
have made a visit of any length, will be sufficient
for each maid. The coachman who drives you to
the train must receive the same amount.</p>

<p>There is, one is glad to say, an occasional household
in which the idea of tips is regarded as contrary
to the spirit of true hospitality. In such homes
the mistress herself sees that the servants receive
extra pay for the extra work entailed by guests, and
the hotel atmosphere suggested by tipping is fortunately
done away with.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BREAD-AND-BUTTER NOTE</div>

<p>After the guest has returned to her own home,
her duties toward her recent hosts are not at an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
end until she has written what is slangily known as
“the bread-and-butter letter.” This is simply a note,
telling of one’s safe arrival at one’s destination, and
thanking the hostess for the pleasant visit one has
had. A few lines are all that etiquette demands, but
it requires these, and decrees that they be despatched
at once. To neglect to write the letter demanded
by those twin sisters, Conventionality and Courtesy,
is a grave breach of the etiquette of the visitor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Hospitality as a duty has been written up from
the beginning of human life. The obligations of
those who, in quaint old English phrase, “guesten”
with neighbors, or strangers, have had so little attention
it is no wonder they are lightly considered,
in comparison.</p>

<p>We hear much of men who play the host royally,
and of the perfect hostess. If hospitality be reckoned
among the fine arts and moral virtues, to
“guesten” aright is a saving social grace. Where
ten excellent hosts are found we are fortunate if we
meet one guest who knows his business and does it.</p>

<p>The consciousness of this neglected fact prompts
us to write in connection with our cardinal virtue
of giving, of what we must perforce coin a word to
define as “Guestly Etiquette.” We have said elsewhere
that the first, and oftentimes a humiliating
step, in the acquisition of all knowledge, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
making a pudding to governing an empire, is to learn
how not to do it. Two-thirds of the people who
“guesten” with us never get beyond the initiatory
step.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GUESTS ARE NOT BOARDERS</div>

<p>The writer of this page could give from memory
a list that would cover pages of foolscap, of people
who called themselves well-bred and who were in
the main well-meaning, who have deported themselves
in hospitable homes as if they were registered
boarders in a hotel.</p>

<p>Settle within your own mind, in entering your
friend’s doors, that what you receive is not to be
paid for in dollars and cents. The thought will deprive
you at once of the right to complain or to
criticize. This should be a self-evident law. It is
so far, however, from being self-evident that it is
violated every day and in scores of homes where
refinement is supposed to regulate social usages.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Taking at random illustrations that crowd in on
memories of my own experiences,—let me draw into
line the distinguished clergyman who always brought
his own bread to the table, informing me that my
hot muffins were “rank poison to any rightly-appointed
stomach”; another man, equally distinguished
in another profession, who summoned a
chambermaid at eleven o’clock at night to drag his
bed across the room that he might lie due east and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
west; an author who never went to bed until two
o’clock in the morning, and complained sourly at
breakfast time that “your servants, madam, banked
up the furnace fire so early that the house got cold
by midnight”; the popular musician who informed
me “your piano is horribly out of tune”; the man
and wife who “couldn’t sleep a wink because there
was a mosquito in the room”; the eminent jurist
who sat out an evening in the library of my country-house
with his hat on because “the room was
drafty”;—ah! my fellow housemothers can match
every instance of the lack of the guestly conscience
by stories from their own repositories.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ANNOYING FAMILIARITIES</div>

<p>The guest who is told to consider himself as one
of the family knows the invitation to be a figure of
polite speech as well as he who says it knows it to
be an empty form. One man I wot of sings and
whistles in the halls and upon the stairs of his host’s
house to show how joyfully he is at home. Another
stretches himself at length upon the library sofa,
and smokes the cigar of peace (to himself) at all
hours, an ash-cup upon the floor within easy distance.
A third helps himself to his host’s cigars whenever
he likes without saying “by your leave.” Each may
fancy that he is following out the hospitable intentions
of his entertainers when, in fact, he is selfishly
oblivious of guestly duty and propriety.</p>

<p>One who has given the subject more than a passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
thought might suppose it unnecessary to lay
down to well-bred readers “Laws for Table Manners
While Visiting.” Yet, when I saw a man of
excellent lineage, and a university graduate, thump
his empty tumbler on the table to attract the attention
of the waitress, and heard him a few minutes
later call out to her “Butter—please!” I wished
that the study of such a manual had been included
as a regular course in the college curriculum.</p>

<p>A true anecdote recurs to me here that may soothe
national pride with the knowledge that the solecisms
I have described and others that have not added to
the traveled American’s reputation for breeding,
are not confined to our side of the ocean.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENGLISH FRANKNESS</div>

<p>Lord and Lady B——, names familiar some years
back to the students of the “high-life” columns of
our papers, were at a dinner party in New York
with an acquaintance of mine who painted the scene
for me. Lady B——, tasting her soup as soon as
it was set down in front of her, calls to her husband
at the other end of the table: “B——, my
dear! Don’t eat this soup! It is <i>quite filthy!</i> There
are tomatoes in it!”</p>

<p>We Americans are less brutally frank than our
English cousins. Yet I thought of Lady B—— last
week when my vis-à-vis,—a slim, pretty, accomplished
matron of thirty, or thereabouts—at an admirably-appointed
family dinner, accepted a plate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
soup, tasted it, laid down her spoon and did not
touch it again, repeating the action with an entrée,
and with the dessert of peaches and cream. She did
not grimace her distaste of any one of the three
articles of food, it is true, being, thus far, better-mannered
than our titled vulgarian. In effect, she
implied the same thing by tasting of each portion
and declining to eat more than the tentative mouthful.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">SELF-DISCIPLINE</div>

<p>To sum up our table of rules: Bethink yourself,
from your entrance to your exit from your host’s
house, of the sure way of adding to the comfort
and pleasure of those who have honored you by inviting
you to sojourn under their roof-tree. If possessed
of the true spirit of hospitality, they will find
that pleasure in promoting yours. Learn from them
and be not one whit behind them in the good work.
If they propose any especial form of amusement,
fall in with their plans readily and cordially. You
may not enjoy a stately drive through dusty roads
behind fat family horses, or a tramp over briery
fields with the hostess who is addicted to berrying
and botanizing—but go as if that were the exact
bent of taste and desire. A dinner party, made up
of men who talk business and nothing else, and their
over-dressed wives, who revel in the discussion of
what Mrs. Sherwood calls “The Three Dreadful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
D’s”—Disease, Dress and Domestics—may typify to
you the acme of boredom. Comport yourself as if
you were in your native element and happy there.
The self-discipline will be a means of grace in more
ways than one.</p>

<div class="sidenote">NEVER SHOW BOREDOM</div>

<p>On Sunday accompany your hosts to their place
of worship with the same cheerful readiness to like
what they like. You may be a high church Episcopalian
and they belong to the broadest wing of
Unitarians or the straitest sect of Evangelicals. Put
prejudice and personal preference behind you and
find consolation in the serene conviction of guestly
duty done—and done in a truly Christian spirit.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>THE VISITED</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">IT has been said,—and with an unfortunate
amount of truth, that the gracious old-fashioned
art of hospitality is dying out. Those who keep open
house from year’s end to year’s end, from whose
doors the latch-string floats in the breeze, ready for
the fingers of any friend who will grasp it, are few.</p>

<p>The “entertaining” that is done now does not
compensate us for the loss of what may be called
the “latch-string-out” custom of the days gone by.
Luncheons, teas, dinners, card-parties, receptions
and the like, fill the days with engagements and hold
our eyes waking until the morning hours, but this
is a kind of wholesale hospitality as it were, and
done by contract. Such affairs remind one ludicrously
of the irreligious and historic farmer-boy
who, reminiscent of his father’s long-winded “grace
before meat,” suggested when they salted the pork
for the winter that he “say grace over the whole
barrel” and pay off a disagreeable obligation all at
one time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">SERVANTS AND GUESTS</div>

<p>Perhaps if our hostess were frank she would
acknowledge a similar desire when she sends out
cards by the hundreds and fills her drawing-rooms
to overflowing with guests, scores of whom care to
come even less than she cares to have them. But
there seems to be a credit and debit account kept,
and once in so often it is incumbent on the society
woman to “give something.” Florists and caterers
are called to her aid, and, with waiters and assistants
hired for the occasion, take the work of
preparation for the entertainment off my lady’s
hands.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In speaking of hospitality in this chapter, we refer
especially to the entertaining of a visitor for one,
or many days in the home. Not long ago we made
a point of asking several housekeepers why they
did not invite friends to visit them. Three out of
four interviewed on the subject agreed that the servants
were the main drawback. The fourth woman,
who was in moderate circumstances, confessed that
she did not want guests unless she could “entertain
them handsomely.”</p>

<p>To obviate the first-mentioned difficulty, every
housekeeper should, when engaging a servant, declare
boldly that she receives her friends at will, in
her home, and have that fact understood from the
outset of Bridget’s or Gretchen’s career with her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
At the same time she should remember that extra
work should mean extra pay or its equivalent in
help. It is astonishing how inconsiderate many
women, otherwise kindly, are in their relation to domestic
servants.</p>

<p>As to the reason given by the fourth housekeeper,
it is too contemptible to be considered by a sensible
woman. Our guests come to see us for ourselves,
not for the beauty of our houses, or for the elegance
of our manner of living. The woman whose house
is clean and furnished as her means permit, who
sets her table with the best that she can provide for
her own dear ones, is always prepared for company.
There may be times when the unlooked-for coming
of a guest is an inconvenience. It should never be
the cause of a moment’s mortification. Only pretense,
and seeming to be what one is not, need cause
a sensation of shame. If a friend comes, put another
plate at the table, and take him into the sanctum
sanctorum—the home. With such a welcome the
simplest home is dignified.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">MEETING THE GUEST</div>

<p>But as to the invited guest. The hostess knows
when she wishes to receive her friend, and, in a
cordial invitation, states the exact date upon which
she has decided, giving the hour of the arrival of
trains, and saying that she or some member of her
family will meet the guest at the station. One who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
has ever arrived at a strange locality, “unmet,”
knows the peculiar sinking of heart caused by the
neglect of this simple duty on the part of the hostess.</p>

<p>The letter of invitation should also state how long
the visitor is expected to stay. This may be easily
done by writing—“Will you come to us on the
twenty-first and stay for a week?” or, “We want
you to make us a fortnight’s visit, coming on the
fifteenth.” If one can honestly add to an invitation,
“We hope that you may be able to extend the time
set, as we want to keep you as long as possible,” it
may be done. If not meant, the insincere phrase is
inexcusable.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE GUEST CHAMBER</div>

<p>Elaborate preparations should be avoided—preparations
that weary the hostess and try the tempers
of servants. The guest-chamber will be clean, sweet
and dainty. No matter how competent a chambermaid
is, the mistress must see for herself that sheets,
pillow-slips and towels are spotless, and that there
are no dusty corners in the room. A trustworthy
thermometer should hang in full view, that the guest
may regulate by it the temperature of her room. If
the visitor be a woman, and flowers are in season,
a vase of favorite blossoms will be placed on the
dressing-table. The desk or writing-table will be
supplied with paper, envelopes, pens, ink, stamps
and a calendar. Several interesting novels or magazines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
should be within reach. All these trifles add
to the home-like feeling of the new arrival.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">LET YOUR GUEST ALONE</div>

<p>A welcome should be cordial and honest. A
hostess should take time to warm her guest’s heart
by telling her that she is glad, genuinely glad, to
have her in her home. She should also do all she
can to make the visitor forget that she is away from
her own house.</p>

<p>All this done, the guest should be <i>let alone!</i> We
mean this, strange as it may seem. Many well-meaning
hostesses annoy guests by following them
up and by insisting that they shall be “doing something”
all the time. This is almost as wearing and
depressing as neglect would be. Each person wants
to be alone a part of the time. A visitor is no exception
to this rule. She has letters to write, or
an interesting book she wants to read, or, if she
needs the rest and change her visit should bring her,
it will be luxury to her to don a kimono and relax
on the couch or bed in her room for an hour or two
a day. The thought that one’s hostess is noting and
wondering at one’s absence from the drawing-room,
where one is expected to be on exhibition, is to a
nervous person akin to torture.</p>

<p>Allow all possible freedom as to the hour for
rising, provide a certain amount of entertainment
for the visitor in the way of outdoor exercise (if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
she likes it), callers, amusements and so forth, and
then (again) in plain English, let her alone!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One must never insist that a guest remain beyond
the time set for her return, if the guest declares sincerely
that to remain longer is inadvisable. To
speed the parting guest is an item of true hospitality.
The hostess may beg her to stay when she feels that
the visitor can conveniently do so, and when her
manner shows that she desires to do so. But when
the suggestion has been firmly and gratefully declined,
the matter should be dropped. A guest who
feels that she must return to her home for business,
family or private reasons, is embarrassed by the insistence
on the part of her entertainers that such return
is unnecessary.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">A GUEST’S EXPENSES</div>

<p>Of course, the visitor in one’s house should be
spared all possible expense. The porter who brings
the trunk should be paid by the host, unless the
guest forestalls him in his hospitable intention. Car-fares,
hack-hire and such things, are paid by the
members of the family visited. All these things
should be done so unobtrusively as to escape, if possible,
the notice of the person entertained.</p>

<p>If a woman have two maids, the second maid
should, shortly before the retiring hour, go to the
guest’s room, turn down the covers of the bed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
provide a pitcher of fresh drinking-water. In the
event of having one maid only, the hostess will perform
these offices herself.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">TRUE HOSPITALITY</div>

<p>No matter what happens—should there be illness
and even death in the family—a hospitable person
will not allow the stranger within her gates to feel
that she is in the way, or her presence an inconvenience.
There is no greater cruelty than that of
allowing a guest in the home to feel that matters
would run more smoothly were she absent. Only
better breeding on the part of the visitor than is
possessed by her hostess will prevent her leaving
the house and returning to her home. Should sudden
illness in the family occur, the considerate person
will leave. But this must be permitted only
under protest. To invite a friend to one’s house,
and then seem to find her presence unwelcome is
only a degree less cruel than confining a bird in a
cage, where he can not forage for himself, and
slowly starving him. If one has not the hospitable
instinct developed strongly enough to feel the right
sentiment, let him feign it, or refuse to attempt to
entertain friends. The person under one’s roof
should be, for the time, sacred, and the host who
does not feel this is altogether lacking in the finer
instincts that accompany good breeding.</p>

<p>We know one home in which hospitality is dispensed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
in a way no guest ever forgets. From the
time the visitor enters the doors of this House Beautiful
she is, as it were, enwrapped in an atmosphere
of loving consideration impossible to describe. One
guest, visiting there with her children, was horrified
at their being taken suddenly ill with grippe,—so ill
that to travel with them just then was dangerous.
She was hundreds of miles away from home with
the possibility of the children’s being confined to
the house for some days to come. The physician
summoned confirmed her fears. The distressed
mother knew only too well what an inconvenience
illness is,—especially in a friend’s house instead of
in one’s own home.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AN IDEAL HOSTESS</div>

<p>All the members of the household united in
making the disconcerted woman feel that this home
was the one and only place in which the little ones
should have been seized with the prevailing epidemic;
that it was a pleasure to have them there under
any circumstances; that to wait on them and
their mother was a privilege. The sweet-voiced,
sweet-faced hostess, herself an invalid at this time,
drew the anxious visitor down on the bed beside her
and kissed her as she said:</p>

<p>“Dear child! try to believe that you and yours
are as welcome here as in your own dear mother’s
home.”</p>

<p>Surely of such is the Kingdom of Heaven!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>HOSPITALITY AS A DUTY</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">IF ours were a perfect state of society, constructed
on the Golden Rule, animated and guided
throughout by unselfish love for friend and neighbor,
and charity for the needy, there would be no
propriety in writing this chapter. Home, domestic
comfort and happiness being our best earthly possessions,
we would be eagerly willing to share them
with others.</p>

<p>As society is constructed under a state of artificial
civilization, and as our homes are kept and our
households are run, the element of duty must interfere,
or hospitality would become a lost art. Even
where the spirit of this—one of the most venerable
of virtues—is not wanting, conscience is called in to
regulate the manner and the seasons in which it
should be exercised.</p>

<p>As a corner-stone, assume, once for all, that a
binding obligation rests on you to visit, and to receive
visits, and to entertain friends, acquaintances
and strangers in a style consistent with your means,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
at such times as may be consistent with more serious
engagements. Having once issued an invitation,
you are sacredly bound on the day named to
give yourself completely to your guests. To invite
people to dinner and then ask them to leave early
in order that one may accept an invitation that one
has received in the meantime, would seem impossible
to a woman of right instincts—but it has been done,
at least by women of social prominence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RETURNING COURTESIES</div>

<p>It may sound harsh to assert that you have no
right to accept hospitality for which you can never
make any return in kind. The principle is, nevertheless,
sound to the core.</p>

<p>Those who read the newspapers forty years ago
will recall a characteristic incident in the early life
of Colonel Ellsworth, the brilliant young lawyer
who was one of the first notable victims of the Civil
War. His struggles to gain a foothold in his profession
were attended by many hardships and humiliating
privations. Once, finding the man he was
looking for on a matter of business, in a restaurant,
he was invited to partake of the luncheon to which
his acquaintance was just sitting down. Ellsworth
was ravenously hungry, almost starving, in fact,
but he declined courteously but firmly, asking permission
to talk over the business that had brought
him thither, while the other went on with the meal.</p>

<p>The brave young fellow, in telling the story in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
after years, confessed that he suffered positive agony
at the sight and smell of the tempting food.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A RECIPROCATING SPIRIT</div>

<p>“I could not, in honor, accept hospitality I could
not reciprocate,” was his simple explanation of his
refusal. “I might starve, I could not sponge!”</p>

<p>Sponging—to put it plainly—is pauperism. The
one who eats of your bread and salt becomes, in
his own eyes—not in yours—your debtor. For the
very genius of hospitality is to give, not expecting
to receive again. (This by the way!)</p>

<p>I do not mean if your wealthy acquaintance invites
you to a fifteen-course dinner, the cost of
which equals your monthly income, that you are in
honor or duty bound to bid her to an entertainment
as elaborate, or that you suffer in her estimation,
or by the loss of your self-respect. But by
the acceptance of the invitation you bind yourself
to reciprocation of some sort. If you can do nothing
more, ask your hostess to afternoon tea in your own
house or flat, and have a few congenial spirits to
meet her there. It is the spirit in such a case that
makes alive and keeps alive the genial glow of good
will and cordial friendliness. The letter of commercial
obligation, like for like, in degree, and not
in kind, would kill true hospitality.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Your friend’s friend, introduced by him and calling
on you, has a proved claim on your social offices.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
If you can not make a special entertainment for him,
ask him to a family dinner, explaining that it is
such, and make up in kindly welcome for the lack
of lordly cheer. If it be a woman, invite her to
luncheon with you and a friend or two, or to a
drive, winding up with afternoon tea in some of
the quietly elegant tea-rooms that seem to have been
devised for the express use of people of generous
impulses and slender purses. It is not the cost in
coin of the realm that tells with the stranger, but
the temper in which the tribute is offered.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENTERTAINING THE STRANGER</div>

<p>“I do not ‘entertain’ in the sense in which the
word is generally used,” wrote a distinguished woman
to me once, hearing that I was to be in her
neighborhood. “But I can not let you pass me by.
Come on Thursday, and lunch with me, <i>en tête-à-tête</i>.”</p>

<p>I accepted gladly, and the memory of that meal,
elegant in simplicity, shared with one whom my
soul delights to honor, is as an apple of gold set in
a picture of silver.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The stranger, as such, has a Scriptural claim on
you, when circumstances make him your neighbor.
In thousands of homes since the day when Abraham
ran from his tent-door to constrain the thirsting
and hungering travelers to accept such rest and refreshment
as he could offer them during the heat of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the day, angels have been entertained unawares in
the guise of strangerhood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POETIC JUSTICE</div>

<p>“Did you know the B——’s before they came to
our town?” asked an inquisitive New Englander of
one of her near neighbors.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then—you won’t mind my asking you?—why
did you invite them to dinner on Thanksgiving Day?
It’s made a deal of talk.”</p>

<p>Abraham’s disciple smiled.</p>

<p>“Because they were strangers, and seemed to be
lonely. They are respectable, and they live on my
street.”</p>

<p>Poetical justice requires me to add that the
B——’s, who became the lifelong friends of their
first hostess in the strange land, proved to be people
of distinction whom the best citizens of the exclusive
little town soon vied with one another in “cultivating.”
In ignorance of their antecedents the imitator
of the tent-holder of Mamre did her duty from the
purest of motives.</p>

<p>Not one individual or one family has a moral or
a social right to neglect the practise of hospitality.
Unless one is confined to the house or bed by illness,
one should visit and invite visits in return.</p>

<p>We are human beings, not hermit crabs.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<small>THE HOUSE OF MOURNING</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE observance of mourning is a difficult matter
to treat, for individual feeling enters
largely into the question. Still, there are certain
rules accepted by those who would not be made remarkable
by their scorn of conventionalities.</p>

<p>The matter of mourning-cards and stationery has
been treated in the chapter on “Calls and Cards,”
and on “Letter-Writing.” A word may here be
added with regard to the letter of condolence. This
should be written to the bereaved person as soon
as practicable after the death for which she mourns.
It must not be long, but should express in a few
sincere words the sympathy felt, and the wish to do
something to help alleviate the mourner’s distress.
This letter does not demand an answer, but some
persons try, some weeks after such letters have been
received, to reply to them. This is not really necessary,
except when the writer is a near friend of
the family. In many cases, a black-edged card bearing
the words, “Mr. and Mrs. —— wish to thank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
you for your kind sympathy in their recent bereavement,”
is mailed to the writer.</p>

<p>If one does not write a letter, one may send to
or leave at the house of mourning a card, bearing
the words, “Sincere sympathy,” upon it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">ATTENDING A FUNERAL</div>

<p>The funeral notice in the daily papers is now
sometimes accompanied by the request, “Kindly
omit flowers.” To send flowers after the appearance
of such a notice is the height of rudeness and
shows little respect to the dead and none for the
family.</p>

<p>If there are more flowers than can be taken to
the cemetery, those left may be sent to the inmates
of hospitals, who need not know that they were intended
for a funeral. Those who attend a funeral
should dress quietly, but they need not wear black
unless they prefer to do so.</p>

<p>While few persons would be guilty of attending
a funeral out of curiosity, there are undoubtedly
some who do. Sensitive people are growing to realize
that the last ceremony for the dead is too sacred
to be shared except with those who are really entitled
by close ties to be present and have signified by
personal messenger those whom they desired should
be present.</p>

<p>In attending a funeral one should be prompt, and
yet not so far ahead of the hour set as to arrive before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the <i>final</i> arrangements are completed. At a
church or house funeral, one should wait to be
seated as the undertaker or his assistant directs.
Nor should one ever linger after the services to
speak to any members of the family, unless one is
particularly requested to do so. One should not
expect to look on the face of the dead unless one
is asked to do so.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">CLOSING THE CASKET</div>

<p>In churches of two denominations it is not customary
to have the coffin opened to the public gaze.
It is a pity that this law is not universal, but it is
becoming more common to have the casket left
closed through the entire service. It certainly spares
the mourners the agonizing period during which the
long line of friends, and strangers who come from
vulgar curiosity, file past and look on the unshielded
features of the dead. Some one has said that the
custom of allowing the curious who did not know
the deceased, and who cared nothing for him, to
gaze on his face after death, seems to be taking an
unfair advantage of the dead.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Many persons prefer a quiet house funeral for
one they love, for there are few persons vulgar or
bold enough to force themselves into the house of
mourning, where only those who knew and loved
the departed are welcome. But the method of personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
invitation makes the presence of such people
impossible.</p>

<p>At a house funeral the clergyman stands near the
head of the coffin while he reads the service, the
audience standing or sitting as the custom of the
special service used demands.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE CHURCH FUNERAL</div>

<p>At a church funeral, the clergyman meets the
coffin at the door and precedes it up the aisle, reading
the burial service. As he begins to read, the
congregation rises and stands as the procession
moves forward. When, after the services, the coffin
is lifted by the bearers, the congregation again rises
and remains standing until the casket has been taken
from the church. A private interment, or one at
the convenience of the family, is now almost universal.
Unless invited, no outsider, even if he be
a friend of the family, will go to the cemetery under
such circumstances.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After the funeral, and when one’s friends have
begun to realize sorrow, is the time when it is the
hardest to bear. It is then that the sympathetic person
may do much toward brightening the long and
dreary days in the house of mourning. Flowers
left at the door occasionally, frequent calls, an occasional
cheering note, a bright book lent, are a few
of the small courtesies that amount to actual benefactions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Only those who have had to learn to live
with a grief that is almost forgot by others know
what such tokens of thoughtful sympathy mean.
All who count themselves friends should call within
a month, always telling the maid that if the ladies
do not feel like appearing they are not to do so.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A WIDOW’S DRESS</div>

<p>The heaviest mourning demanded by conventionality
is worn by a widow, but even she is now allowed
to dispense with the heavy crape veil. In its
place is the long veil of nun’s veiling, which is worn
over the face only at the funeral. With it is a face-veil,
trimmed with crape, and a white ruche or
“widow’s cap” stitched inside of the brim of the
small bonnet. The dress is of Henrietta cloth, or
other lusterless material, and may be trimmed with
crape. Black suède gloves and black-bordered handkerchiefs—if
these are liked—are proper. The
widow seldom discards her veil under two years,—some
widows wear it always. After the first year
it is shortened.</p>

<p>It is a matter for congratulation that crape, that
most expensive, unwholesome, perishable and inartistic
of materials, is worn less and less with each
passing year. Surely to have to wrap one’s self in
its stiff and malodorous folds adds discomfort to
grief. It is now seldom worn except by widows, although
a daughter may wear it for a parent, a
mother for her child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>The matter of the mourning-veil is one each person
must settle for herself, although the strictest
followers of fashion deprecate its use for any
women except widows. Some bereaved daughters
and mothers wear it, but not for a long period, seldom
longer than six months.</p>

<p>Mourning for the members of one’s immediate
family may be worn for a year, then lightened.
Mourning for a relative-in-law is lightened at the
end of three or six months.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">INCONGRUOUS MOURNING</div>

<p>While on this subject it would be well to call attention
to the fact that one should either wear conventional
black, or no black at all. For a widow
to wear, as a well-known woman did recently, a long
veil and gray suède gloves, borders on the ridiculous.
Nor should velvet, cut jet, satin and lace
be donned by those wearing the insignia of grief.
Nor are black-and-white combined deep mourning.
They may be worn when the weeds are lightened,
but not when one is wearing the strictly conventional
garb of dolor. Even widows may wear all white,
but not with black ribbons, unless the heavy black
has been laid aside for what may be called the “second
stage” of bereavement. At first, all materials
either in black or white, must be of dull finish.
Dresses may be of nun’s veiling, Henrietta cloth,
and other unshining wool fabrics, or of dull, lusterless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
silks. Simple white muslins, lawns and mulls
are proper, but must not be trimmed with laces or
embroidered.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">MOURNING FOR MEN</div>

<p>For men, black or gray suits, black gloves and
ties, and a black band upon the hat, are proper. The
tie should be of taffeta or grosgrain silk, not of satin
or figured silk. I would lay especial stress on the
poor taste of the recent fad of wearing a black band
upon the sleeve of a colored coat. The same rule
applies to the would-be-smart young woman who
sports a narrow black strip upon the left arm of
her tan rain-coat or walking-jacket. If she can not
wear conventional and suitable mourning, she would
better wear none.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">JUDGING THE BEREAVED</div>

<p>The matter of the period of time in which a
mourner should shun society is a subject on which
one may hesitate to express an opinion, as there are
too many persons whose views would not coincide
with ours. In this case, as in others, one must, to
a certain extent, be a rule unto one’s self. One who
is very sad shrinks naturally from going into gay
society for the first few months after bereavement.
The contrast of the gaiety with the mourner’s feelings
must, of necessity, cause her pain. To such
a one we need suggest no rules. To those less sensitive
or less unhappy, it would be well to say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
deep black and festive occasions do not form a good
combination. While one wears crape and a long
veil one should shun receptions, opera boxes, teas
and all such places. Later, as one lightens one’s
mourning, one may attend the theater, small functions
and informal affairs. Even the very sad may
go to the theater when they would shrink from attending
an affair at which they would meet strangers
and where they would be obliged to laugh and be
gay. After the first few months of the conventional
retirement are past the sufferer must decide for herself
what she may and may not do. We would add,
rather as a suggestion than as a law of etiquette,
that the onlooker forbear to judge of the behavior
of the recently-bereaved. The heart knoweth its
own bitterness, and if that bitterness can be sweetened
by some genial outside influence, let others
hesitate to condemn the owner of the heart from
seeking that sweetness. Those whom we have lost,
if they were worth loving, would be glad to know
that our lives were not all dark.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The seemly custom followed in France of sending
to relatives and friends of the family a letter
advising them of a death is not, unfortunately,
known in this country, where we, with less propriety,
advertise our griefs and our gaieties alike in
the public prints.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>AT TABLE</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE matter with which we have especially to
do just now is the manners of the eater. The
table may be simply or elaborately laid, as circumstances
and taste dictate. It goes without saying
that every housekeeper will have her board as attractive
in appearance as possible, and that she will
never omit the bowl or vase of flowers from the
center of it. If her purse will not allow this decoration
in midwinter she may substitute a potted
plant or a vase containing a few sprays of English
ivy, or wandering-jew.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The men never sit down until the women are
seated. Each man draws out for her the chair of
the woman who sits next him. Even in the quiet
home-life this practise should be observed, and husband
or son must always draw from the table the
chair in which the wife or mother is to sit, and remain
standing until she is seated. The host is seated
last. As soon as all are at the table the napkin is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
unfolded and placed across the knees. It need not
be opened wide, unless it is a small breakfast or
luncheon serviette.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">CARVING THE ROAST</div>

<p>If a man undertakes to carve game or a roast
he should learn to do it well and quietly, <i>never</i>
sharpening his knife to the annoyance of his guests
or rising from his seat for a better “hold.” Many
women carve excellently, but as there is a feeling
that it is a difficult thing to do, a clever guest who
knows his hostess well, will sometimes beg leave to
take her place for the performance of this task.
When the hostess begins to eat, the others follow her
example. All food must be eaten slowly, and, above
all, noiselessly. Many a fastidious person has had
her enjoyment of her soup spoiled by the audible
sipping of it by her vis-à-vis or her next neighbor.
The soup should be lifted from the plate by an outward
sweep of the spoon, and taken quietly from
the side, not the tip, of the spoon. It is bad form
to break bread or crackers into the soup, and the
plate containing the liquid should never be tipped
in order to obtain every drop of the contents.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Fish is not to be touched with the knife. There
is reason for this. The cutting of some delicate
sea-food with a steel knife affects the flavor of it,
and renders it less delicate. The flesh is so tender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
that it may be cut with a silver fork, and this is the
only implement permitted in its manipulation. The
same rule applies to salads, which are never, by the
followers of conventionality, touched with the knife.
Lettuce is, before serving, broken into bits of a convenient
size to be carried to the mouth. If this is not
done, the eater should cut it with the side of the
fork, or fold each bit over into a convenient size
for eating.</p>

<div class="sidenote">USES OF THE KNIFE</div>

<p>It should not be necessary to remind people in
this day that the knife must only be used for the
purpose of cutting food. When it has fulfilled this
duty, being wielded by the right hand, the food
being held in place by the fork in the left, the fork
is then taken in the right hand, and the knife laid,
with the edge turned outward, across the back of
the plate. It is generally supposed that all classes
know the use of the knife, yet in a fashionable restaurant
there recently sat a handsomely-attired woman
carrying French peas to her mouth with the
blade of her knife. However, it is not so long since
Chesterfield gave elaborate directions as to the
proper way to eat with the knife! “Other times,
other manners!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is an atrocity to pile several kinds of food upon
the fork, mold them into a small mound with the
knife, and then “dump” the load into wide-open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
jaws. Each kind of viand should be lifted, a
small bit at a time, upon the fork. Mastication
should be absolutely noiseless, and the process conducted
with the lips closed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Bread, even when hot, may be broken off, a small
piece at a time, buttered upon the plate, then eaten.
All hot bread should be torn open or broken with
the fingers, never cut into bits. To butter a slice of
bread by laying it upon the table or, more disgusting
still, upon the palm of the hand, is a relic of barbarism.
At breakfast and luncheon the small bread
and butter plate, with a small knife, is set at the
upper left-hand side of the place and the bread
should be kept on it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">HOW TO EAT FRUITS</div>

<p>Such fruits as apples or peaches are peeled with
a small silver fruit knife, cut into quarters and eaten
with the fingers. Oranges are peeled and then pulled
apart or they may—at breakfast—be cut in halves
and eaten with the aid of the sharp-toothed orange
spoon. Grapes should be eaten from behind the
half-closed hand into which skin and the seeds then
fall.</p>

<p>It is permissible to use one’s knife to convey salt
from one’s individual salt-cellar, if no tiny spoon
for this purpose is supplied. But the salt shaker is
a much more convenient device, though in damp
weather the maid must see that the salt will “shake.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>A mouthful must never be so large as to make it
impossible for the eater to speak if a question be
addressed to him while he is disposing of it. Nor
can too great stress be laid upon the duty of slow
eating and thorough mastication of all kinds of
food. Not only does it add to the grace of the
table-manners, but it prevents indigestion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Never touch the food on the plate with the fingers,
to push it upon the fork. If anything must be used
for this purpose, let it be a bit of bread, but, if possible,
dispense altogether with assistance of any
kind. The fork should be equal to getting up all
that is absolutely essential, and comfort does not
depend upon securing every particle of meat or
vegetables with which the plate is supplied.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE SPOON AND THE FORK</div>

<p>Every year the spoon has fewer uses, and the
fork has more. Now, when it is possible, desserts
are taken with the fork where a spoon used to be
employed. Pie, cake, ice-cream and firm puddings,
with all kinds of fruit, are eaten with the fork. Some
persons hold a fork awkwardly in an up and down
fashion instead of in the proper graceful horizontal
one. Of course the spoon is still essential for semi-solids,
such as custards, creams and jellies.</p>

<p>There are a few things besides breads of all varieties
which one is allowed to eat with the fingers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
Such are Saratoga chips, olives and small bird-bones,—these
last to be taken daintily in the fingertips.
It is no longer considered good form to eat
asparagus with the fingers, although some very well-bred
persons still do it. It is certainly an ugly sight
to witness one’s opposite neighbor eating asparagus
in this manner. It is possibly not so unattractive as
to see him eat corn from the cob. But no better
way of disposing of this last vegetable has as yet
been invented. If corn is served on the cob, the
cob should be broken into two or three pieces before
it is lifted to the mouth. If one is so unlucky as to
drop a fork or spoon, allow the maid to pick it up
and to bring a fresh one, without making any comment
whatever. A glass of wine overturned, however,
demands apology and the hope that the hostess’
cloth will not be irremediably stained.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">AFTER-DINNER COFFEE</div>

<p>At breakfast, one may drink coffee with sugar
and cream, but when black, or after-dinner coffee
is served in a small cup, which is known as a <i>demi-tasse</i>,
cream should be omitted. To ask for this
when it is not on the table is the height of rudeness.
One should learn to drink one’s after-dinner coffee
without cream. Sugar is, of course, permissible.
There is sense in this dictate of Fashion, as in many
of the other rules laid down by this seemingly arbitrary
dame. The coffee taken at the end of a hearty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
meal is intended to act as a “settler” to the repast
and to aid the work of digestion. This it does much
more easily when clear than when “qualified” with
milk or cream. Before drinking from a glass of
water one should brush one’s lips with the corner
of the napkin.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After the salad course at a dinner, and before the
dessert is brought in, the waitress removes the
crumbs from the table, using a tray or plate and
folded napkin for this purpose. When she does
this it is bad form for the guest to lay in the tray
any bits of bread that may be left at his place or to
assist the waitress by moving his glass, salt-cellar,
or any other article that may be left on the table.
A good waitress removes salt-cellars, pepper-cruets
and such articles, before crumbing the table, leaving
only the glasses at each place. It is her business to
do all this so quietly and deftly that the guests are
scarcely conscious of it. To further this end, let
the whole affair be attended to by the waitress, and
do not seem to notice any lapses on her part.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE FINGER-BOWL</div>

<p>At the end of the meal the finger-bowls are used.
The ends of the fingers are dipped in the water, and
the lips touched with these; then mouth and hands
are wiped upon the napkin which is left, unfolded,
at the side of the plate, if one is taking only one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
meal in the house. If a longer stay is expected,
one may watch one’s hosts to see what they do with
their napkins, and follow their example.</p>

<p>Dinner over, the hostess makes the movement to
rise, and she, with the other ladies, proceeds to the
parlor. There they are joined later by the gentlemen.
At an informal or family dinner, the men
and women may leave the table together, the men
standing aside to let the women pass out first, and
in the drawing-room cigars may be lighted by the
men after they have asked permission of the women
to smoke.</p>

<p>All these rules with regard to the company dinner
apply to the family dinner as well. One can
not be too careful in observing the laws of table etiquette
in the family circle if one would be at ease
in company.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">AVOID APOLOGIES</div>

<p>One warning I would give to the hostess or homemaker:
Do not apologize unless necessary! If a
dish is a signal failure, say with an apologetic smile
that you regret that such a thing was spoiled in the
baking, or that you fear the meat is very rare, and,
unless the matter can be remedied, let it go at that.
You but embarrass your guests and put them to the
disagreeable necessity of reassuring you, if you
dwell upon the matter.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The host should never insist that one be served<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
to any dish after it has been positively declined. To
do this is a mistake no matter how kindly the intention.
There is an old saying that one man’s meat
is another man’s poison. If your host insists, however,
on helping you after your refusal, you must
for decorum’s sake accept the food but you need do
no more than taste it.</p>

<p>At a formal dinner one is not served a second
time to any dish, but at an informal dinner, what
are called “second helps,” are quite permissible and
convey a compliment to the hostess. When a plate
is sent back to the carver for a fresh supply of meat,
the knife and fork should be laid side by side upon
it, not held in the hand, as some persons insist. And
when one has finished eating, the knife and fork are
laid in the same manner upon the plate, the tines
of the fork up.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE NAPKIN</div>

<p>The napkin must never be tucked into the neck
of gown or shirt, nor must it be fastened to the belt
or the waistcoat button. After one leaves the
nursery one should be able to eat without a bib.</p>

<p>One of the characteristics of a well-appointed
house is an abundance of fresh linen, including clean
napkins, if possible, at every meal, certainly every
day at dinner. A large napkin for dinner use is
handsome, but it may be too large for convenience.
No one wishes to be smothered by a “young table-cloth,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
as some one has called these immense serviettes.
Breakfast napkins are distinctly smaller than
dinner napkins.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MINOR TABLE LAWS</div>

<p>At breakfast a blue and white service is often
liked and is certainly pretty. At dinner the china
may be as costly as one can afford. If the purse is
limited, the plain white or gold-band is a good
choice, making a quietly elegant appearance and being
easily replaced.</p>

<p>In drinking coffee use the spoon to stir it slightly
and to sip from, but never leave the spoon in the
cup.</p>

<p>When a fowl is carved if your host asks which
piece you prefer it is entirely correct to express a
preference, and indeed you will probably embarrass
him if you decline to do so.</p>

<p>A wine-glass should be lifted to the lips by the
stem, not by the bowl.</p>

<p>A waitress should be cautioned against the common
practise of handing dishes and particularly
water glasses with the thumb stuck inside the rim.</p>

<p>Never tip the soup plate to get the last mouthful.</p>

<p>The nervous habit some people have of playing
with the silver or crumbling bread on the cloth looks
very bad.</p>

<p>Artichokes are broken apart with the fingers, the
heart being conveyed to the mouth on the fork.</p>

<p>One should sit easily erect at table at a convenient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
distance from the board. Do not sit on your
spine.</p>

<p>If you are in doubt as to how to proceed with any
course, take a cue from your hostess.</p>

<p>Eggs, when boiled, should be served in individual
egg cups, opened by lightly cracking the top of the
shell with the knife, and eaten from the shell by the
aid of tiny egg spoons.</p>

<p>It should go without saying that when a dish is
passed, one should always take the portion one
touches; do not presume to make a choice of rolls
or of fruit.</p>

<p>Never put salt on the cloth.</p>

<p>To attempt to assist the waitress by gathering
together the articles before you, is a mistake. Leave
that to her, and appear unconscious of her presence
while she is so engaged.</p>

<p>To hand a dish across the table is distinctly bad
form. This habit has been designated as “the boarding
house reach.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>IN THE HOME</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">“AS a man thinketh in his heart, so is he,” declares
the Book of books. And as a man is
in his home, so will he be abroad, when the “company
manner” rubs off.</p>

<p>One frequently becomes involved in some quite
unexpected circumstance that scratches off the beautiful
surface-coloring, if it be only as deep as the
hue on the stained wood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ADJUSTABLE COURTESY</div>

<p>The manner that one puts on when one goes into
a friend’s house, or dons when one is “in company,”
is what may be called “adjustable courtesy.” If it
is not made of the best material it seldom fits well.</p>

<p>Not long ago a friend drove with us by the house
of a man whose society manners, when first seen,
call forth admiration. Upon this particular spring
afternoon, he sat upon the veranda of his home. As
we approached, and he met our glance, he sprang
to his feet, bowed low and remained standing until
we had passed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>“What a pretty attention to pay to two women!”
we exclaimed.</p>

<p>Our friend gave a significant shrug, and called
our notice to the fact that the man’s wife had, before
we came by, driven up to the end of the veranda,
and that she was, unaided, climbing from a high
trap in which she and her two little girls had been
driving, while her husband lolled at ease in a steamer
chair. It took the presence of a woman who did
not belong to him to bring him to his feet. Looking
back, after we had passed, we noted that he had
again resumed his lounging attitude, and that his
wife was lifting the second child from the carriage.</p>

<p>Such is adjustable courtesy! It is not an every-day
garment, and is, consequently, worn only to impress
strangers.</p>

<p>No one can afford to do the injustice to his better
self of allowing himself to become careless toward
those with whom he lives, or to neglect the small
sweet courtesies that should be found in the home,
if anywhere. It is the home etiquette that makes
the public etiquette what it should be. This reminder
can not be repeated too often.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In many houses men forget to show the respect
due to wife, mother and sisters. Parents should
train their sons to stand when a woman enters the
room, and to remain standing until she sits down.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
The considerate husband rises and offers his wife
the easy chair in which he is seated. She, knowing
that he is weary after a hard day at the office, will
not take the chair, but she will appreciate the little
attention, and love him the better for it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE BARBAROUS TOOTHPICK</div>

<p>In the talk on table etiquette, we have touched on
many points, but not on certain things that seem
too petty to be mentioned, as it is not supposed that
persons of polite breeding need to be reminded of
them. It is only when one looks in on the home-life
of some so-called “nice” people that one feels
that perhaps after all to call attention to these points
would not be superfluous.</p>

<p>One of these is the use of the toothpick. To
wield this in company is barbarous; to produce it
at table is disgusting. The idea of having a glass
full of toothpicks upon the family board is as disagreeably
suggestive, and more disgusting, than
would be the presence of a bowl of water, flanked
on one side by a cake of soap, on the other by a
wash-cloth. Cleansing of all parts of the body
should take place in the privacy of one’s own apartment
or in the bath-room.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Tipping back the chair at table or in company is
bad form. One small child was broken of this habit
when she lost her balance while swaying backward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
from the table on the two hind-legs of her chair,
and gave her head a furious bump on the floor.
Sobbing, she was lifted to her feet, and met the stern
gaze of her father.</p>

<p>“I am very glad,” he said, “to see that you are
badly enough hurt to be reminded never to tip your
chair again. It is rude! If some grown persons I
know had received a similar lesson in childhood,
they might not offend the taste of others as they
now do.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">TAKING SALT AND BUTTER</div>

<p>Taking butter from one’s butter-plate with the
tip of a fork that has been already in one’s mouth
is another disagreeable trick. The like may be said
of the same way of helping one’s self to salt. If a
small butter-knife and salt-spoon are not provided,
the tip of the knife may be used in their stead.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Bolting food and pushing back one’s chair without
the preliminary and apologetic “Excuse me!”
is the custom of some otherwise estimable householders.
It would be better to eat less, if one’s time
be limited, and eat slowly, as food thus taken in a
rush is of small use in the internal economy. A
few mouthfuls, well masticated, will possibly do
more good, and certainly produce less discomfort,
than three times as much swallowed in indigestible
chunks. And after the short repast has been partaken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
of, let the master of the house set the example
of common decency by uttering the conventional
“Excuse me!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">CARING FOR THE NAILS</div>

<p>One hopes that it would be a difficult matter to
find anybody so far oblivious of ordinary good
manners as to clean his nails before others, but, let
us blush to say it! one does meet many men who
clean and pare their nails in the presence of family
and intimate friends. Perhaps it is due to the fact
that a woman does not carry a pocket-knife that she
is seldom seen doing this. Her manicure instruments
are kept upon her dressing-table, and it is in
her own room that she performs this very necessary
part of her toilet.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The ugly habit that many children acquire of
biting the nails can be overcome by requiring them
to wear gloves until they master it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">GOOD TASTE IN SPEECH</div>

<p>Young people should be taught that the question
of age, in general conversation, is tabooed, that
too much manner is as bad as too little, and that a
good manner is even more to be desired than good
manners. They should be instructed to say “Thank
you,” not “Thanks,” to avoid “photo,” “auto,” etc.,
saying instead “photograph,” “automobile,” or
better, “motor-car,” or simply “car.” “Crowd,” as
“our crowd,” is very bad for “circle,” “set” or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
“group of friends.” A girl should never say “hello,”
and no one should use it at the telephone. “Good
morning,” “yes,” “well” or the mention of one’s
name are courteous methods of beginning a telephone
conversation. “Waistcoat” is to be preferred
to “vest.” Modern usage trains children to say
“Yes, mother,” “Yes, Aunt Clara,” “No, Miss
Smith,” instead of “Yes, ma’am,” “No, ma’am,”
as of old. Only in the remoter districts of the South
does the earlier fashion survive among grown people
where it must be admitted to have a quaint
charm. When a child sneezes, if he is well taught
he will say quietly, “Excuse me.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A rudeness that a man will perpetrate in his own
home, from which he would shrink in the home of
another person, is that of wearing his hat in the
presence of women. Every mother should train the
small boy of the house to remove his hat as soon
as he enters the front (or back) door. To do this
will then become second nature, and it would not
be probable that he could ever be guilty of the rudeness
of standing in hall or parlor and talking to
mother, sister or other feminine relative with his
hat on his head. One mother at least positively refuses
to hear what her little son has to say if he addresses
her with his head covered. One may regret
that with older men other women have not the like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
courage of their convictions. A man’s hat is so
easily removed we wonder just why he should leave
it on in the house, even if he is going out again in
a moment. The man whose courtesy is not of the
adjustable type will not do this, and these remarks
are absolutely superfluous as far as he is concerned.</p>

<p>Nor will it be necessary to remind him to pick up
the handkerchief, thimble, scissors or book that the
woman in his presence lets fall,—even if she be his
wife. To assist the feminine portion of humanity
comes natural to the thoroughbred.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">COURTESY IN GIRLS</div>

<p>And just here I would say a word to the young
person of the so-called weaker sex. It is to remind
her that she, as well as her brother, owes the duty
of respect to her elders. She is too prone to think
that the boys of the family should rise for the older
people, should remain standing until parents are
seated, and should always be ready to run errands,
or to deny themselves for their seniors. The duty
to do all these things is incumbent on the girl or
woman in the presence of those who are her elders
or superiors. The girl or young matron who reclines
in an easy chair, while her grandparent,
mother, father, or woman-guest stands, is as guilty
of rudeness as her brother would be were he to do
the same.</p>

<p>It is not on the men alone that the etiquette of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
the home depends. Indeed, it is the place of the
mother to see that little lapses in good breeding are
not overlooked. And she is the one who should, by
her unselfishness, her gentle courtesy, and unfailing
politeness in even the smallest items, show forth the
spirit of true kindness, on which all good manners
are founded.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE CULTIVATED VOICE</div>

<p>We are all united in thinking that a well-trained
voice ministers to the happiness of those about in
a rare degree. Yet it is too infrequently remembered
that the place to cultivate clear enunciation, low
tones and amiable inflections is at home. Teachers
in elocution and voice culture may do a large part
in bringing out latent powers, but the foundation
for the culture of the speaking voice should be laid
at home. High shrill voices, choppy pronunciation,
a nervous speaking manner will render unattractive
matter of a high mental quality. Mothers should
begin early and work late on this important matter
of cultivating the voices of their children. Voice
quality and enunciation, it should be realized, are
more important than pronunciation. It is not a vital
question whether a man pronounce the word “exquisite”
with the accent on the first or the second
syllable, but “childern” is a vulgarism, though one
hears it often. Truly of one who uses it, it may
be said, “his speech bewrayeth him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CARE OF BOOKS</div>

<p>Respect for books is one of the lessons to be
taught in a properly regulated house. And by this
phrase, I do not mean respect for the contents. That
goes without saying. I mean respect for the proper
care of those best ministers to minds and souls.
Children should be taught to handle books carefully,
to cut the leaves properly, to open books without
breaking the leaves apart at the back. They should
be instructed not to soil or to mark them and to put
them back in place when not in use.</p>

<p>The person who lends books may keep a list of
them, and it is not discourtesy if the volumes lent
are not returned within a reasonable length of time
to ask for them. Many people who are quick to
borrow are careless about returning. The standard
of ethics in regard to returning books is with many
people as low as the general standard in regard to
the return of umbrellas. A book-plate is a great
aid to the possessor of a library in keeping it together.
Moreover, a pretty book-plate seems to give
a touch of individuality to one’s volumes. The next
best thing to individual bindings and tooled leather
is this slighter mark of identity in one’s library.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One thing that makes for peace and etiquette in
the home is the recognition of the rights of others.
For this reason one member of the family should
never inquire into another’s correspondence, into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
his engagements, social or otherwise, or ask questions
even of his nearest and dearest. The fact that
a man is one of a family, every member of which
is dear to him, does not mean that he has no individuality,
or that he must share the secrets of his
friendships or business matters with any one. He
should always feel in the home that any confidences
he may care to give are most welcome, but that such
confidences are never demanded or expected.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RESPECT FOR PRIVACY</div>

<p>In recognizing these rights of others, one must
remember that each person’s own room is sacred to
himself. It is inexcusably rude for one member of
a family to enter the room of any other member
without first knocking at the door and receiving
permission to “come in.” Each human being should
feel that he has one locality that belongs to him,
where he can be alone unless he decrees otherwise.
To further this end the wife should knock at her
husband’s door before she enters his room, and the
husband should show her the same consideration,
while brothers and sisters should always give the
warning tap, which is virtually a request for permission
to enter, before opening the door that the
occupant of the room has closed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Americans are much criticized for their fondness
for rocking chairs. Certainly there are many of us
who should learn to use them less violently. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
woman who rocks steadily back and forth while she
is talking to her friends is lacking in the repose that
is an essential element of charm. Equally bad habits
are the snapping and unsnapping of a purse and
twisting a handkerchief or a theater program into
a roll. To hum below the breath when some one
else is talking is extremely rude, and not less so
when any two people are together.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COURTESYING FOR LITTLE GIRLS</div>

<p>For little girls, the courtesy of our grandmothers
has been revived. It is certainly a charming mark
of respect for them to show to older people.</p>

<p>A courtesy that should never be omitted is the asking
of permission to open and read letters received
while one is in conversation with others.</p>

<p>Children should be rigidly instructed not to ask
for delicacies of food when they are visiting, otherwise
they may become a nuisance.</p>

<p>The habit children often acquire at school, of
sticking their lead pencils into their mouths to moisten
them, is unhygienic and ugly, and should be
broken up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<small>IN PUBLIC</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE subject of this chapter is so large that we
almost despair of doing more than touch on a
few of the many points it should cover.</p>

<p>Perhaps it would be well to give first a few rules
for that most public of places,—the street.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A MAN AND HIS HAT</div>

<p>The question as to the etiquette of raising the
hat is one that demands attention,—and yet the
rules are simple.</p>

<p>A man always uncovers his head completely when
he returns a woman’s bow. He does the same when
he meets a man he knows walking with a woman,
whether she be known to him or not. When a man
is walking or driving with a woman and she bows
to a man or woman she meets, her escort lifts his
hat. On parting with a woman he bares his head.
If he stand and talk with her, he should hold his hat
in his hand unless she asks him to cover his head,
or unless the day be cold,—in which case he says,
“Will you pardon me if I put on my hat?” Then,
when he leaves her, he again uncovers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>As a safe rule in whist is, “When in doubt, lead
trumps,” so a safe rule for a man in public would
be, “When in doubt, take off your hat.”</p>

<p>Some men of fine feeling take off their hats when
a funeral procession passes them in the street, indeed
in Europe this is an established custom. In the
South, in this country, old-fashioned gentlemen
sometimes raise their hats to each other. Abroad,
men who pass women on a stairway invariably lift
their hats. In hotel elevators, gentlemen always
take off their hats when ladies are present,—some
men do it in all elevators under these circumstances.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When a man meets a woman on the street, and
wishes to talk with her for a moment, he should, if
time allow, turn and walk a little way with her,
rather than stop and thus hinder her. If he have a
business engagement that makes this impossible, he
should apologize for not doing so, in a few words,
as—“Pardon me for not walking with you instead
of stopping you, but my train leaves in fifteen
minutes,” or, “I have an appointment in ten minutes.”</p>

<p>On a cold day, when a man stands talking with
a woman with his head uncovered, she should say,
“Pray put on your hat! I am afraid you will catch
cold.” He should accede to her request, saying
“Thank you!” as he does so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>It is a woman’s place to bow first, when she meets
a man. Unless they are old friends, the man does
not lift his hat until he has received this sign of
recognition from a woman.</p>

<p>Men who were called on to shake hands with
women formerly murmured an apology for the
glove, but this is no longer customary. A man waits
for a woman to make the first move to shake hands
unless he knows her very well.</p>

<p>When men meet each other on the street they may
recognize each other as they please,—by a nod, a
wave of the hand, or by touching the hat. For a
man to touch his hat to a woman is an insult, unless
he be a servant—as a coachman receiving an order
from his mistress—when he acknowledges the order
by touching the brim of his hat with his hand. Did
more men appreciate that they were giving the
“coachman’s salute” to a woman, mortification, if
not courtesy, might prevent a repetition of the offense.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">ON THE STREET-CAR</div>

<p>When a man is a woman’s escort and they board
a street-car, she should, without comment, allow
him to pay her fare. When they get on the same
car by chance, she should make the move to pay her
fare, but if the man hands the money to the conductor
before she does so, she should simply bow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
and say “Thank you!” To dispute about who shall
pay car-fare is bad form.</p>

<p>Meaningless introductions in street-cars or other
public places are to be avoided. It is not desirable
to bring two people together in such a place unless
some real purpose is served.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">LOUNGING IN PUBLIC</div>

<p>Women should be careful as to the way in which
they sit. The woman who spreads her knees looks
as awkward as the man who keeps his tightly together.
Recently it became a fad in certain places
for women to lounge in the street-car and to cross
one knee upon the other. Needless to say, really
well-bred women did not follow the fad. Even
men who have been strictly trained will not cross
the knees when calling on ladies.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When all seats are taken in a car and a woman
enters, a gentleman will rise and give her his seat,
lifting his hat as he does so, which courtesy she
should always acknowledge by saying “Thank you!”
cordially and audibly. Women are much criticized
for taking seats in cars without an acknowledgment
of the courtesy, and, undoubtedly, they often do.
On the other hand, men as frequently, by turning
their backs, make acknowledgment impossible.</p>

<p>If the car be full and a woman enters carrying
a baby in her arms, any girl or young matron present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
should resign her seat to the burdened passenger,
unless some masculine passenger has manliness
enough to do so. To the credit of human nature,
be it said that we have never seen a mother with a
child in her arms stand for two minutes, no matter
how crowded the car might be.</p>

<p>Of course a young woman should resign her seat
to an elderly woman, as she will do the same for a
very old or infirm man.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">WHEN WALKING TOGETHER</div>

<p>The custom of a man and a woman walking arm
in arm at night is rapidly falling into disuse. For
couples to walk in this way in the daylight has not
been customary for years, unless the woman be so
aged or invalided as to need the support of her escort’s
arm. Now, even after dark, there is hardly
any need of a man’s arm for a woman’s guidance in
the brilliantly lighted streets. If the couple be walking
through a poorly illuminated street, or on a
country road, or climbing a steep hill, the man offers
the woman his arm. He should also do this at
night when he holds an umbrella over her head.
Even in the daylight, when they cross a crowded
thoroughfare together, he should lightly support her
elbow with his hand to pilot her over. He should
never, unless they be members of the same family,
take her arm in order to guide her.</p>

<p>In public a man must never attract a woman’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
attention by clutching her arm, or—odious action!—by
patting her on the shoulder or back, or nudging
her. If there is such a noise about them that the
mere speaking her name in a low voice will not reach
her ears, he may respectfully touch her on the arm
saying at the same time, “Excuse me, please!” Personal
liberties are always in poor taste, but never
more vulgar than in a place where they are noted
by all observers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">AFTER THE THEATER</div>

<p>If a man escort a woman home, she may utter a
brief “Thank you!” to him on parting with him.
Profuse expressions of gratitude on such an occasion
are bad form. On parting from him, after he has
taken her to the theater, opera or any other entertainment,
she may, when she bids him good night,
say cordially, “I am indebted to you for a very
pleasant evening,” and, if she wish, she may add,
“We shall be glad to have you call at any time.”</p>

<p>A man must never linger at a woman’s door to
utter his good-bys, or to speak a few final sentences.
Door-step chats may do for nurse-maids and their
attendants. They are out of place in higher circles.
A man rings the bell for the woman he is accompanying,
sees that she is safely admitted, and, if it
be too late for him to enter the house for a few minutes,
removes his hat, says good night and takes his
leave.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">KISSING IN PUBLIC</div>

<p>So much fun has been made of the custom that
some women have of kissing each other in public
places on meeting and parting, it is surprising that
even gushing girls still adhere to the ridiculous fashion.
When people embrace, let it be in the sanctity
of the home, or where there are no amused observers.
If a kiss has no meaning, then let Fashion do
away with it; if it means tender affection, it is too
sacred a token to be exchanged where dozens of
people may look on and comment on it. It is hardly
too sweeping an assertion to make when one says
that among mere acquaintances, kisses are best omitted
altogether. Do let us have some method of salutation
for those we really love that is not given as
frequently and freely to every chance acquaintance
or casual friend! One woman declares that beyond
her relatives there is no grown person she willingly
kisses, except two women whom she has known for
years, and she respects them too much to embrace
them in the presence of an unsympathetic world.
A warm hand-clasp will suffice until the people who
love each other can be alone.</p>

<p>Of course there are exceptions to this rule, as
to many others. When a man puts his family
upon the train or boat which is to carry them from
him, he will uncover his head, and kiss each one
of the beloved group. Other such exceptions will
suggest themselves. Common sense and good taste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
should keep one from making a mistake in these
matters.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">GOOD FORM IN NAMES</div>

<p>It is in wretched form for a man to speak of
a woman by her first name when talking to casual
acquaintances. It is as bad form, or nearly as
bad, for a woman to speak of a man by his last
name, as “Brown” or “Smith.” It takes very little
longer to say “Miss Mary” or “Mr. Brown,” and
the impression produced is worth the extra exertion.
Nor, unless they be members of the same
family, does a man address a girl by her first name
in a crowd of outsiders. In her home she may
be “Mary” to him. In public, let him address her
as “Miss Smith.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One of the most annoying habits indulged in in
public is that of being late at the theater. It is
trying to have to lose whole lines of a play while
one rises, gathering up bonnets and wraps to do
so, to allow the belated person to pass who sits
beyond one. It is a pity that theater-goers do not
take more pains to show one another the kindness
of being in their places before the curtain rises.</p>

<p>In entering a theater, the man stands aside to
allow the woman to go into the door ahead of him,
then steps forward to show his tickets to the usher,
at the same time taking two programs from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
table, or from the boy holding them. The coupons
are handed back to the man, and kept by
him, in case any mistake should arise in regard to
the seats. Then the woman follows the usher down
the aisle, followed by her escort. In some western
cities the man goes first down the aisle, standing
aside to allow the woman to take the inner seat.
It is well for both men and women to remove their
coats and wraps, either in the vestibule of the theater
or before going into their seats. After sitting
down, the woman takes off her hat and holds it
in her lap throughout the performance.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DISPOSING OF ONE’S WRAPS</div>

<p>A better custom in theaters large and modern
enough to have ample dressing-rooms is for the
woman to remove all her wraps there. The house
looks much prettier than when each woman is piled
with her belongings, the woman is more comfortable,
and she has had besides the opportunity of
a glance in the mirror at her hair. If she is at
all sensitive to drafts she may prefer to take a light
scarf with her as when the curtain rises there is
often a very cold air, especially on those sitting
close to the stage. In most cities in this country
women do not wear full dress unless they are to
sit in a box.</p>

<p>At all evening entertainments a woman’s head
is uncovered. A woman who retains her hat even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
when sitting in a box inevitably suggests that she
wishes to be conspicuous. If a woman is invited
to be one of a box-party she need not bother to
go to the dressing-room, as in most cases each box
has hooks on which cloaks may be hung and a
mirror convenient for the single glance that is desired.</p>

<p>The same rules hold good with regard to a musicale
or a concert.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">TALKING AT A CONCERT</div>

<p>I wish there were any chance that anything
anybody might say could impress on women that
their habit of talking or, worse still, whispering,
during a musical performance is abominably rude!
Let those who have suffered by this almost universal
practise testify to the misery it causes. To
have one’s favorite passage from a beloved composer
marred by “Now this is where he dies, you

and now just listen to the chirping of the
dear little birds!” or,—“I don’t think I <i>can</i> lunch
with you to-morrow, dear, but perhaps the next
day,” “<i>Do</i> you think those long coats are becoming
to short women?”—who that has undergone the
agony of being in the vicinity of such a talker can
fail to utter a fervent “Amen” to the frenzied petition
that they be suppressed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV<br />

<small>HOTEL AND BOARDING-HOUSE LIFE</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THERE is no better place than a hotel in which
to study the manners, or lack of manners,
of the world at large. It is here that selfishness
is rampant, and unselfishness hides its diminished
head.</p>

<p>Before we discuss the ethics of hotel life it will
be well to give a few general directions as to what
one does from the time one enters the door of the
building which will, for a long or short time, be
his place of abode. He proceeds at once to the
office, makes known his desires with regard to a
room or rooms, and writes his name in the register
handed to him by the clerk. He is then assigned
to his room, and a page directs him thither, carrying
hand luggage. To this page he hands his trunk-check,
and the trunk is soon brought to his room.</p>

<p>Upon the inside of the door in every hotel room
is tacked a set of rules of the house, and these are
in themselves sufficient to instruct our uninitiated
traveler in most of what is expected of him. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
here learns that the hotel is not responsible for
valuables left on the bureau or table of the room,
that the guest is requested to keep his trunk locked,
and to lock his door upon going out, and to leave
his key at the office; that valuable papers and jewelry
can be left in the safe of the hotel; at what
hours meals are served and so on. All these directions
the considerate person will observe. None
of them is unreasonable. There are many things
for which no printed rules are given which are
none the less essential to the correctness of demeanor
on the part of a guest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">AT THE HOTEL TABLE</div>

<p>Loud talking is one of the things to be avoided.
One must remember that in a hotel more than in
any other place is the warning of the Frenchman
likely to be proved true,—“The walls themselves,
my lord, have ears!” Each room has another room
next to it, and the partitions are thin. The transoms
all open upon a general hall in which can
be heard any loud remark spoken in any one of
the rooms. If one does not discuss affairs one
wishes kept secret, one must bear in mind the fact
that other people may be annoyed while resting,
reading or talking, by fragmentary bits of conversation
wafted to them. At the hotel table one must
also bear this in mind. Loud talking in a public
place stamps the speaker as a vulgarian, or a person<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
who has seldom been outside of his own home,
and has never learned to modulate his voice.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On entering a hotel dining-room, the traveler
pauses until the head waiter, or one of his assistants,
indicates a table at which he may sit. If
this table be too near the radiator or window, or
otherwise undesirable, the guest may courteously
ask if he can not be placed in another locality.
When a man and a woman are together the man
enters the room first, and leads the way to the
table, on the first occasion of their taking a meal
at the hotel. After that, if they occupy the same
table each day, the woman enters the room first
and proceeds to her seat, followed by the man.
He, or the waiter, draws back her chair for her
and seats her. The man, of course, remains standing
until she is seated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GIVING ONE’S ORDER</div>

<p>The menu card is handed to the man, with a
pad or slip of paper and pencil. Upon this, after
discussion with the woman, he writes his order.
As a rule he orders the entire meal, except the
dessert, at once. The sweets can be decided on
later.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I wish I could impress on the minds of persons
in a hotel that it is wretched form to criticize audibly
the viands set before them. The person sitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
near you is not edified to hear you remark
that the soup is wretched, the beef too rare, the
coffee lukewarm. If you have any fault to find,
do so to the waiter and in such a tone that the
other guests can not hear it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AVOID FAULTFINDING</div>

<p>Above all, do not scold the waiter for that for
which he is not to blame. He does not purchase
the meat, nor does he fry the oysters. Show him
that you appreciate this fact, and ask him politely
if he can not get you a better cut, or oysters that
are not burned. Some persons seem to think that
it elevates them in the opinion of observers if they
complain of what is set before them. They fancy,
apparently, that others will be impressed with the
idea that they are accustomed to so much better
fare at home than that they now have that it is
a trial for them to descend to the plane on which
others are eating. The fact of the case is that
the person who is accustomed to dainty fare, and
to even-threaded living, is too well-bred to call the
attention of strangers to the fact.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>While we are on this subject it would be well
to remind the thoughtless person that when he dines
with a friend at that friend’s hotel, on his invitation,
he is a guest. It is therefore rude for him
to comment unfavorably on the dishes on the table.
When, under such circumstances, a guest says to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
his host <i>pro tem.</i>, “My dear fellow, they do not
give you good veal here!” or, “Are you not tired
of the mean butter you eat at this hotel?” he is
criticizing in an offensive manner the best that his
host can offer him, since he has no house of his
own in which to entertain. The guest should act
as if it were his friend’s private table, and forbear
to criticize fare or service.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">HOTEL TIPPING</div>

<p>One of the often unconsidered items of expense
in hotel life is the “tips” that one must give. In
no other place is one’s hand so often in one’s
pocket. A porter carries a bag, and he must be
tipped; another carries up a trunk, he must be
tipped; one rings for iced water, and the boy bringing
it expects his ten cents; one wants hot water
every morning, and in notifying the chambermaid of
this fact, must slip a bit of silver into her palm. The
waiter at one’s table must be frequently remembered,
and the head waiter will give one better
attention if he finds something in his hand after
he shows the new arrival to a table, and, of course,
on leaving, one will also give a fee. So it goes!
When, however, one is staying by the week at a
hotel, “tips” need be given only once a week,—unless
some unusual favor is asked. We may rebel
against the custom, and with reason. But as not
one of us can alter the state of affairs, it is well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
to accept it with a good grace, or reconcile one’s
self to indifferent service.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">CHILDREN IN A HOTEL</div>

<p>The matter of children in a hotel is one on
which so much has been said and written that
there is little left to say. At the first glance one
is tempted to resent the fact that many hotel proprietors
object to having children accompany their
parents to the public table, and that some even demur
at their presence in the house. Child-lovers
have said bitterly that the celestial “many mansions”
seem to be the only abodes in which the little ones
are welcome,—and all these opinions have a great
deal of truth on their side. But it is not until
one has undergone the annoyance of ill-governed
children in a house where there are no restrictions
enforced on them that one sees the other side of
the shield. One large boarding-house at a fashionable
summer resort is popular to mothers of large
families because the proprietor does not object to
children. A guest there last season decided that
if that were the case said proprietor had no nerves.
She soon learned that childless guests declined to
stay at the place. Children raced up and down
the long corridors, screaming as they went; they
played noisily outside of bedroom doors; they ate
like little pigs at the hotel tables. In short, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
made the house a purgatory for all except other
children and their mothers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TWO TYPES OF MOTHERS</div>

<p>There are two types of mothers in this land of
ours that are greatly at fault. One is the mother
who hands the management of the children over
to a nurse or several nurses, and she is, of course,
the rich woman whose children see her seldom, and
that not often enough to bother her. The other
type is the woman who has nerves toward all things
except her own children’s noise. She is such a
doting parent that she is, to all appearances, blind
and deaf to the fact that her own offspring drive
to the verge of insanity other “grown-ups” with
whom they come in contact. Verily the American
youngster is having everything his own way in
private and public nowadays! Dwellers in hotels
are to be pardoned if they beg that he be kept
in private until his parents learn to govern him,
and by thus doing, show mercy to other people.</p>

<p>While the rules that govern propriety should be
adhered to everywhere, there is no other place
where they should be more strictly observed than
at the summer hotel, or the boarding-house of a
fashionable watering-place. It may not be an exaggeration
to state that there are few decent places
where they are more openly disregarded. With
the trammels of city life one seems to lay down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
an appreciation of the fitness of things generally.
The free intercourse, the rapidly-made acquaintances,
the mingling of many sorts of peoples in
the huge caravansary—tend to make us cast aside
conventionalities. Husbands, running down from
the city for a Sunday with their wives, find them
absorbed and happy in the gay life about them,
and quite sufficient unto themselves when the husbands
return to counting-room and office on Monday
morning. There is always a class of men
who, having nothing else to do, are habitués of the
summer hotel, where they flirt with the wives of
other men and make themselves generally useful
and talked about.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AVOIDING GOSSIP</div>

<p>There may be no harm in all this sort of thing,
but it is well for the discreet maiden and matron
to avoid giving any cause for the enemy to blaspheme,—in
other words, for the gossip to make
herself busy and dangerous. To this end, late hours
in shaded corners of verandas, moonlight sails and
walks, and beach-promenades well on toward midnight,
are to be shunned. While these may be
innocent per se, they give rise to scandal. The
young girl may always have a chaperon to whom
to refer as to the proprieties, but it is not the
young girl who is most talked about. The married
woman whose husband lets her have her own
way is a law unto herself, and she must be careful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
not to make that law too lax. It takes very
little to set silly tongues wagging; it takes months
and years to check the commotion they have made.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">PROMISCUOUS FRIENDSHIPS</div>

<p>Promiscuous intimacies at summer resorts are a
great mistake. Unless a woman knows all about
a fellow guest, she should not get into the habit
of running into her room, or of talking with her
as with a lifelong friend. She may be pleasant
toward all, and intimate with none.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that there is no other
hotbed of gossip equal to a hotel or a boarding-house.
Women, released from the cares and anxieties
of housekeeping and home-making, turn their
time and thoughts to fancy work and scandal. Each
arrival runs the gantlet of criticism and comment,
and afterward becomes the subject of “confidential”
conversations upon veranda and in parlors.
Here, as everywhere else, work that will
occupy the mind is a sovereign cure for this habit.
One can usually sit in one’s own room, but if one
does not, there is always a book to be read in
parlors or on the veranda, which will show the
would-be gossip or retailer of scandal that one is
too much occupied to engage in conversation.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TWO GOOD RULES</div>

<p>Certainly in a hotel no one lives unto himself,
but each must consider the comfort of his neighbor.
Such a semi-public life is at the best a poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
substitute for a home existence. Two rules to be
observed will make other rules of hotel or boarding-house
etiquette sink into insignificance compared
with their importance.</p>

<p>First: Do nothing that will make others uncomfortable.</p>

<p>Second: Pay attention to your own business,
and pay no attention to that of other people.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI<br />

<small>IN THE RESTAURANT</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE woman who, for the first time, is taken
to dinner in a large restaurant is naturally
slightly confused by the experience. She needs,
however, to know only a few essential points in
order to be able to conduct herself with propriety
and to enjoy her evening. She and the man who
has taken her will leave their wraps in charge of
the maid or hat man at the door. If she has worn
a hat, she will retain this, but if she has gone in
a carriage or a car with only a light scarf about
her head, she need not be embarrassed, for many
of the women in the room will be without head-gear.
In this country, it is not customary for
women dining in public places to wear gowns cut
more than slightly low.</p>

<p>When the two are shown to their table, the
woman should remove her gloves, keeping them
in her lap or perhaps putting them on an empty
chair that is near. Neither the gloves nor a hand-bag
should ever be placed on the table. The man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
should do the ordering, but as he will consult his
guest’s wishes, she should be prepared to express
these definitely and with sufficient promptness not
to keep the waiter standing too long. Unless something
very elaborate is desired, a plate of raw oysters,
a little fish or a bit of bird, a salad and a
sweet with coffee, with the things that go with
them, will suffice. The custom as to ordering is
not the same in all restaurants and if two women
be alone, the one who is acting as hostess should
ask whether the waiter wants the entire order at
once or not. Usually a slip of paper and pencil
are given which saves the possibility of mistake
on the part of the waiter. Frequently, the portions
of meat and salad and of some other dishes
are abundant for two persons, but it will be well
to make a friend of the waiter to the extent of
asking if this is the case.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The habit of certain fussy people when eating
in a restaurant of wiping off their plates before
they are served is intolerable—and foolish. It is
unpleasant for other people,—besides, if the plates
are not clean, there is no ground for faith in the
napkins.</p>

<p>To snap the fingers at a waiter is to stamp one’s
self as a vulgarian.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A MODERATE ORDER</div>

<p>Order within your means and display no anxiety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
when toward the end of the meal the waiter lays
your bill face downward on the table. When you
are ready to pay it, satisfy yourself that it is correct
and place on the waiter’s tray a sum sufficient
to cover it and the amount of the tip custom says
you must give. If a mistake has been made, a quiet
word will usually prove a sufficient remedy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<small>WHEN TRAVELING</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE selection of proper receptacles for one’s
baggage is the first point to be considered in
making preparations for a journey. The trunk-makers
offer great variety in the material, quality
and price of their wares. The indispensable requisite
of a trunk, whatever be the material of its composition,
is that it shall be strong. Look well to
hinges, lock and corners before buying. A trunk
that will not stand wear and tear is not worth having.
One need not purchase an expensive trunk,
but one can not afford to purchase a cheap one. The
material employed must be good, though the appearance
need not be luxurious. If one can afford
the price, one may find trunks where separate trays
are provided for each gown or where indeed frocks
may be hung at full length and come forth at the
end of a journey as they might come from my
lady’s closet. But for those who can not or do not
care to put sizable sums of money into the carriers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
of their clothes, there are good sensible receptacles
at a moderate price. A steamer trunk, by reason of
its shape and size, is a convenient general-purpose
piece of baggage and is especially to be commended
for short journeys.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE TRAVELING-BAG</div>

<p>The bag one selects has much to do with one’s
comfort in traveling. It should be large enough to
hold a nightrobe, a kimono, one’s toilet articles, also
an extra shirt-waist and a change of underclothing
in case of detention. The size of the bag is important.
It must not be so large that it is a burden
to carry if necessity compels. It must not be so
small that the articles mentioned may not rest comfortably
and without crowding within. As with
trunks, so in bags, one finds a large variety in values.
It pays to get a good bag of nice leather, conveniently
arranged for carrying the articles necessary
to one’s comfort. Such a bag, one that pleases
the eye and in which one may find one’s things without
a distracting search for them, gives an amount
of satisfaction to a traveler beyond the power of
words to convey. One of the most acceptable gifts
that can be made to a person who is not of the stay-at-home
type is a generously fitted traveling-bag. As
thousands of bags are made precisely alike, the
stamping of one’s initials at the end or side may
save time and trouble.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DRESSING FOR A JOURNEY</div>

<p>One should wear dark inconspicuous clothing in
traveling, and of a weight suitable to the season of
the year. Beflowered hats, light gowns, light gloves—unless
these are washable—and jewelry are in
the worst of taste and proclaim the unsophisticated
or the parvenu. To be dressed comfortably and
modestly is the aim of the experienced traveler.
In summer a dark silk dress of light weight with
a silk rain-coat makes an ideal traveling costume,
as neither holds dust. A woman so attired will arrive
at the end of her journey in much better condition
than her less experienced companion who
clings to white (?) blouses. If a fresh veil and a
pair of white gloves are tucked into her bag to be
put on at the last moment, she will be charmingly
immaculate. A black silk bag for the protection of
one’s hat is a good idea though most Pullmans supply
paper sacks for this purpose.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If possible, it is well on a journey to carry with
one something more in the way of money than one’s
traveling expenses. One can not tell what emergency
may arise or what unexpected demands may
be made upon one. Many women carry the funds
not immediately in use, in some sort of pocket
fastened on or made into the petticoat they wear.
One can buy very pretty separate pockets of this
sort made of leather or one can make them of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
stout silk fastened down by a clasp on the flap.
Elaborate preparation in caring for one’s wealth is
the penalty a woman pays for being without pockets
in her clothes. While it is wise for her to put
the funds unnecessary for immediate use in some
such safe place as that described, she should not
keep articles which she may be at any moment called
upon to deliver, in a spot which it is embarrassing
for her to reach. Train conductors and baggage
agents have many a grin and sly smile over the
woman who must reach under her petticoat before
she can deliver up ticket and trunk checks. An
amusing instance of this overcaution, so much more
characteristic of women than of men, occurs to
the writer. An acquaintance, starting on a European
voyage, took the most elaborate means for the hiding
of her valuables upon her person. In transit she
stayed the night at a New York hotel and woke
in the morning to discover, to her horror, that she
had slept all night with the door of her room unlocked
and the key on the outside. A considerable
amount of change in a separate purse from one’s
bills is a convenience and a safeguard.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">MAKING ACQUAINTANCES</div>

<p>A man may, if he chooses, make acquaintances
on a journey, and a woman also, though with less
frequency and freedom. The exigencies of travel
may sometimes make it pleasant for her to render or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
receive aid from another woman or possibly a man;
and this may be the starting-point for acquaintance.
As a usual thing, it is best for a young girl traveling
alone, to avoid all communication with strangers,
as she can not know into what complications it may
lead her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">COMFORT IN A PULLMAN</div>

<p>If one is making a journey that compels night
travel, one must secure one’s section or half-section
in the Pullman or sleeper beforehand. In order to
get good accommodations it is well to do this several
days in advance. The difficulty of getting into
an upper berth makes most women choose the lower,
though it is more costly and decidedly stuffier. When
one climbs aboard a train the porter follows with
one’s belongings, finds one’s section or half-section
and deposits the hand luggage in its place. Some
travelers are very thoughtless in appropriating more
than their share of the space appointed for wraps,
bags, etc. If one has paid for a half-section only,
one has no right to take more than that, unless the
other half of the section remains unsold.</p>

<p>When a traveler wishes his bed made up he should
summon the porter and so declare. Usually an
electric bell between the windows of his section will
enable him to call the porter at any time. If the traveler
is a woman and is for any reason dissatisfied
with her berth or section, she may consult with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
porter about a change which, if the car is not full,
he is often able to arrange for her. For instance,
if a woman having a lower section finds that the
upper is to be occupied by a man, it is often possible,
by the payment of a small sum to the porter, to move
her quarters.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE TIMID TRAVELER</div>

<div class="sidenote">DRESSING FOR THE NIGHT</div>

<p>Many women who find themselves compelled for
the first time to take a sleeping-car, feel timid at the
prospect. But the process is simple though not necessarily
comfortable. Once behind the curtains a
woman may remove all her clothing precisely as she
does at home if she feel equal to the physical ordeal
of putting it on again in a crowded space in the
morning to the accompaniment of rapid motion and
the nausea it often induces. Unless one is a good
traveler, it may be preferable to remove one’s dress,
pinning the skirt to the inside of the curtain to save
its freshness, putting small articles in the swinging
hammock next the windows and for the rest merely
loosening bands. Directly above the head one will
find in all first-class trains a button that when
pressed will give a light by which one can read or
which will help one the better to endure an hour of
nervous wakefulness. A small bottle of brandy or
spirits of ammonia is carried by delicate women to
ward off train sickness. A woman should not hesitate
to summon the porter for extra covers, a glass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
of water or any other service that contributes to
her real comfort. To send for him with too great
frequency shows lack of experience and consideration.
If one is to be called before daylight it is wise
to give one’s self ample time for dressing and so the
porter should be instructed to call one at a certain
time considerably ahead of the hour for leaving the
train. Experienced women travelers do not don
white night-dresses in sleeping-cars, but keep a dark
silk robe for this purpose, insuring equal comfort
and a better appearance in case of illness or accident.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are many small offices for which one may
call upon the porter if so inclined. One must, however,
keep it in mind that he should be rewarded proportionately
at the end of the journey after he has
performed his last office of brushing one off. Twenty-five
cents is the usual amount given to him for
the services rendered in twenty-four hours. An occasional
wary traveler bestows his tip for the first
rather than the last service asked. If a porter appears
sullen this method will be found to have advantages.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before leaving one’s berth in the morning, one
should, as far as possible, get into one’s undergarments
over which one slips a bathrobe or kimono
before going to the toilet-room. One should take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
with one to the toilet comb, brush, tooth-brush,
clothes-brush, wash-cloth, a cake of soap (it is never
wise to use the public cake) and the gown one
intends wearing, with its accessories. All the toilet
articles should be carried in a silk waterproof “companion,”
or better still, in a crash apron with rubber-lined
pockets for soap and towels, to be tied
about the waist. Arrived there one should be as expeditious
as possible in order not to keep others
waiting. One woman’s selfishness in out-staying
her time in the toilet-room may keep ten others in
misery. It is not the time and place for a complete
bath. Nowhere is the quality of true courtesy more
needed than in the toilet-room of a Pullman. When
one has finished one’s ablutions, combed one’s hair
and fastened one’s gown, one should clean the basin
and place the soiled towels out of the way. When
one leaves the room it should be ready for the next
comer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">IN THE DINING CAR</div>

<p>When the announcement is made that breakfast,
dinner or luncheon, as the case may be, is served,
the passenger makes his way to the diner. If this
is crowded he must wait his time patiently and with
courtesy to those about him. Sometimes the meal
is served <i>a la carte</i> (literally, by the card), in which
case a separate charge is made for each article on
the bill of fare or menu. (Menu, by the way, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
pronounced “may-noo,” not “meyn-you” as one
often hears it.) Many dining-cars serve meals <i>table
d’hote</i> (tah-bul-dote) and for these a fixed charge
of one dollar is made. Some train dinners are very
good indeed, others are execrable. If a dish is particularly
bad and one complaint does not produce
a better, the diner should not brow-beat his waiter—who
is not to blame—but may if he choose speak to
the steward in charge. Having been served he
should fee the waiter. The usual fee is one-tenth
the price of the meal, though men, more frequently
than women, give more than this.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">ARRIVING AT A HOTEL</div>

<p>Arrival in a strange city is bewildering to a person
who has traveled little. There are always, however,
in the city railway stations, bureaus of information
where one may find out the necessary things.
If one is desirous of a cab, one may discover there
the most trustworthy line; or, if a car is wanted,
what direction one must take to find the proper one.
Usually the traveler, if intending to go to a hotel,
will have made himself acquainted, before arrival
in the city, with the relative value and expense of
the different ones. A person is much better treated
at such places if he writes or telegraphs ahead for
accommodations. A woman should choose the side
entrance, if there is one, as this is reserved for
ladies. If a woman arrives in a strange city, unaccompanied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
it is sometimes difficult for her to get
the hotel accommodations she desires. At some
hotels they will not admit unaccompanied women
after nightfall. Under these circumstances the
traveler would better go to the hostelries established
by the Young Women’s Christian Association,
where she may feel certain of the character of the
place and entertainment. These places invariably
require that one shall be introduced and one will
do well, therefore, to take a letter from one’s clergyman.
The length of one’s stay is usually limited
but it is sufficient for the ordinary holiday or shopping
visit.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE UNACCOMPANIED WOMAN</div>

<p>If you are arriving in a city and expect to be
“met,” do not, if you can possibly avoid it, take a
train that pulls in at an unearthly hour of the night
or early morning. If you must take such a train,
tell your hostess she is not to meet you, that you
will stay the night at a down-town hotel or at least
will take a carriage. An intelligent woman need
have no fear of danger in arriving in a strange city
alone. She may possibly be annoyed by a bold stare,
even by a question, but the chances are that if she
be quiet in dress and manner she will not suffer
even inconvenience.</p>

<p>Policemen and station officials are always willing
to answer the questions of perplexed travelers. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
little fee sometimes helps them speak more eloquently.
It is not wise to depend upon the chance
passer-by for information. The person whose business
it is to inform you is not likely to tell you
what is untrue. Of him you have a right to expect
something. Of others you have a right to
expect nothing, and you may come in for less than
the value of your expectations.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">ON BOARD A BOAT</div>

<p>The general etiquette of steamboat travel does not
differ from that on board a train. Boat travel is
of a more leisurely sort and begets somewhat less
formality as relates to one’s fellow travelers. Otherwise
the rules of behavior are the same.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>As a parting injunction to the traveler, let me
say,—don’t look worried, cross and over-careful
even if you feel that way. Courtesy to subordinates
will win you attention and service, will straighten
out your difficulties more quickly than any other
method. If you take the ills of traveling with some
sense of humor, with a give-and-take spirit, you
will get more than the benefit of the money your
journey may cost you. If you do not carry an
elastic spirit with you, the finest trip that ever was
planned will bring you little return.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHAPERONS IN EUROPE</div>

<p>A woman who travels abroad must remember
that the rules of chaperonage are much stricter in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
Europe than they are in this country, and that she
is expected to have a companion or a maid. If she
wishes to dispense with these, she must reconcile
herself to foregoing social invitations. If she makes
inquiry she can always learn of particularly desirable
pensions where she may count on finding among
the guests a congenial person to accompany her on
many of her short excursions.</p>

<p>On board the steamship the luckiest passengers in
the dining-salon are those who are fortunate enough
to be allotted seats at the captain’s table.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

<small>IN SPORT</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">SPORT, scientists tell us, is a relic of prehistoric
pursuits; and the so-called sporting instinct is
a stirring of the primeval nature within civilized
breasts. Perhaps that is why more people forget
the first tenets of good breeding when competing
in various forms of outdoor exercise than in nearly
all the other walks of life put together.</p>

<p>The man who would view with an amiable smirk
the spilling of a glass of Burgundy over his white
waistcoat at a dinner, will often exhibit babyish rage
at the breaking of a favorite golf-club or the stupidity
of a caddie. The girl whose self-control permits
her to smile and murmur: “It’s really of no
consequence!” when a dance-partner’s foot tears
three yards of lace off her train, will seldom show
the same calm good-humor when her opponent at
tennis serves balls that are too swift and too hard-driven
for her to return.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are many concrete and a few general rules<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
for behavior in sport of all sorts, the observance or
neglect of which denotes the “thoroughbred” or
the boor far more accurately than would a week full
of ordinary routine.</p>

<p>The general rules apply to every form of sport.
They are, briefly:</p>

<p>First, last and always—keep your temper! Remember
the word “sport” means “pastime.” When
it becomes a cause of annoyance or impatience, or an
occasion for loss of temper, it misses its true aim
and you are not worthy to continue it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">REMEMBER THE OTHER MAN</div>

<p>Second; the “other fellow” has quite as much
right to a good time as you have. Do not play selfishly,
or vaunt your superiority over him. In all
contests, show no elation at victory, or chagrin at
defeat. This is the first and great law. Its observance
differentiates the true sportsman from the mere
sporting-man.</p>

<p>Third; play fairly. The man or girl who will
take an undue advantage of any description over an
opponent, not only breaks the most sacred rules of
good breeding, but robs himself or herself of the
real enjoyment of the game.</p>

<p>Fourth; no sport in which people of breeding can
participate demands loud talking, ill-bred language
or actions, or the abridgment of any of the small
sweet courtesies of life.</p>

<p>To sum up,—good breeding, fairness, self-control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
and patience are needful equipments. Without
any and all of these no man or woman should take
part in sports.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE GOLF-PLAYER</div>

<p>Golf, perhaps, more than any other outdoor pastime,
demands a thorough and judicious blend of
the foregoing qualities. The old story of the Scotch
clergyman, whose conscience would not allow him
to continue both golf and the ministry, and who
therefore abandoned the latter, was of course an
exaggeration. But the idea it expresses is by no
means absurd. When a crowd of people throng the
links—when novice and adept, crank and mere exercise-seeker
are jumbled together in seeming confusion—it
is not always easy to keep a cool head,
a sweet temper and a resolution neither to give nor
to take offense.</p>

<p>Many a golf-player errs in behavior less through
ill-intent than through heedlessness and ignorance
of what the etiquette of the occasion demands. Such
enthusiasts may profit by the ensuing rules which
cover the more salient points of decorum, and which
may enable the beginner to avoid many a pitfall:</p>

<p>When two players “drive off” from the tee they
should always wait until the couple in front of them
have made their second shot and walked off from
it. Thus confusion is averted and the proper distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
maintained. It is a simple rule, but one often
broken.</p>

<p>Three players should always let a pair of players
pass them. Not only should they grant the desired
position, but they should offer to do so before the
question, “May we pass?” can be asked. The pair
in question should (in case such permission is not
volunteered) ask politely to be allowed to move
forward. The yell of “Fore!” is all the strict rules
of the game demand, but the rules of breeding
should come first.</p>

<p>A single player must give way to all larger parties.
This is but fair, since golf is, preeminently,
a match; and those actively engaged in the contest
should have the right of way over a man who is
merely practising. The “single player” must recognize
and yield with good grace. If he desires unobstructed
practise, let him choose some time when
the links are vacant.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ON THE PUTTING GREEN</div>

<p>Never drive on the “putting green” when other
players are there “putting out.” Players should
not neglect to get off the green the moment they
have “holed out.” The place is not intended as an
isle of safety, or a club-house corner where scores
may be computed, gossip exchanged, or the work of
others watched.</p>

<p>If you are at the tee waiting for others to “drive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
off,” never speak, cough, or in any way distract the
attention of the player who is addressing the ball.
Inconsiderate or ill-bred people in this way spoil
hundreds of good drives and thousands of good
tempers every year.</p>

<p>When a man and a woman are playing golf, the
latter should always be allowed to precede on the
first drive off from the first tee.</p>

<p>A man, playing against a woman, should not allow
himself to get too far ahead of her. Do not
leave her to plod on alone. This same rule applies
when playing with another man. Do not go after
the ball after a drive until your opponent drives.
Then walk together in pursuit. Never go ahead
of your partner.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AVOID HASTE IN GOLF</div>

<p>Use no undue haste in golf. Never run!</p>

<p>If you are not employing a caddie, always offer
to carry the clubs of the woman with whom you are
playing. In the same circumstances offer to make
the tee from which she is to drive off. It is optional
with her whether or not to accept your offer.</p>

<p>When you have no caddie allow players who have
caddies to pass you. They will go faster than you
and should have the right of way.</p>

<p>Never make unfavorable criticisms of others’
play. Never, above all, laugh at any of their blunders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">WHEN MOTORING</div>

<p>Automobiling has so increased in popularity that
it is almost a national pastime. And with its growing
favor has sprung up a noxious and flourishing
crop of bad manners. There seems to be something
about the speed, the smell of gasoline or the sense
of superiority over slower vehicles, that robs many
an otherwise well-bred automobilist of all consideration.
Yet the utmost consideration is due, not
only to mere mortals but to fellow “motormen.”</p>

<p>Common humanity, as well as civility, should always
prompt a chauffeur to stop at sight of a disabled
car and to ask if he can be of assistance; to
offer the loan of any necessary tools or extra gasoline;
or even, if necessary, to volunteer a “tow.”</p>

<p>Do not presume on the community of interests
to address the chauffeur or passengers of a passing
car, any more than the passengers of one ordinary
vehicle would address those of another. Do not
stare at another’s car, nor, if at a standstill, examine
the mechanism. This is the height of rudeness.
The fact that you are so lucky as to own a car gives
you no license to investigate the workings of another
man’s machine, or in other ways to make
yourself obnoxious.</p>

<p>When passing a car of inferior horse-power, do
not choose that moment to exhibit your own greater
speed. Be careful also not to give such a car your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
dust nor (so far as you can avoid) to sicken its occupants
with the smell of your motor’s gasoline.</p>

<p>Do not boast of the phenomenal runs you have
made. You are not a record-holder. And when
you become one, the newspapers will gladly exploit
the fact without any viva voce testimony from you.</p>

<p>When meeting a horse vehicle watch closely to
see if the horse shows signs of fear. If he does,
completely stop your car, and if the driver of the
horse be a woman, dismount and lead the horse past
your car.</p>

<p>Do not violate the speed ordinance. The ordinance
was made for public safety, not to spite you.
Do not frighten animals or pedestrians, nor carelessly
steer too near to some farmer’s live stock
which may happen to be in the road. Remember
the owner of the chickens or dogs you may run
over is helping to pay for the smooth road you are
traversing. The road is partly his, and you are in
a measure his guest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">RULES FOR TENNIS</div>

<p>Tennis offers fewer opportunities for “breaks”
than do many other of the sports of the hour. Yet
good breeding is here as necessary as when playing
any other game.</p>

<p>If you have a woman for a partner and it is her
“serve,” do not neglect to pick up and hand her the
balls before each service. Second her more carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
than if she were a man, and take charge of the
extra balls for her.</p>

<p>If a woman is your opponent, remember she has
not the strength and endurance of a man. Serve
gently. Do not slam balls over the net at cannonball
speed and force. Oppose only moderate
strength to her lesser power. Give her the benefit
of the doubt in case of a “let,” or when the ball may
or may not be over the back line.</p>

<p>In “double service” do not serve the second ball
until she has recovered her position from pursuing
the first. The choice of rackets should also, of
course, be hers; and any work, such as putting up
the nets, hunting the lost ball, and so on, devolves
on you.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE YACHTSMAN AS HOST</div>

<p>The yachtsman is of two classes,—the man who
delights in the dangers and seamanship incident on
a cranky “wind-jammer” in a heavy sea, and the
man whose boat is a floating club-house. Both
types are prone to forget at times that their guests
are not so enthusiastic as themselves; that they may
be nervous or inclined to seasickness, and that the
amusements of their host may not always appeal to
them. The man who would never think of causing
inconvenience to a guest on land will show impatience
or lack of sympathy at that same guest’s
timidity or <i>mal de mer</i>, when afloat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>The same rules of behavior that obtain between
host and guest ashore should prevail on the yacht.
The tastes of the latter should be as scrupulously
considered and his or her likes and dislikes be as
considerately met.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">CANOEING</div>

<p>Similar laws of social usages apply to boating
and canoeing. “The fool that rocks the boat” has
received so many warnings and such just and wholesome
condemnation that there is no use wasting
further words on him. No man who values the
safety and comfort of his companion will do anything
to imperil either. A man should always offer
to row, but should give the girl who is with him
the option of doing so if she wishes. He should
hold the boat steady for her and assist her to embark,
having previously arranged the cushions in
the stern and made all other possible plans for her
comfort.</p>

<p>The course they are to take should always be left
to her choice, and her wishes should be consulted in
every way. A girl would also do well to remember
that the man who has taken her boating is doing
all the work and is trying to give her a pleasant
time. She should meet him half-way, and should
try to repress any nervousness she may experience
in being on the water and should welcome the opportunity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
to help when occasionally requested by
her “skipper” to “trim boat.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Swimming is essentially a man’s sport. While
many women are good swimmers, they usually lack
the strength and endurance to make them men’s
equals in this line. A man should therefore be careful
to avoid overtaxing the strength of the girl who
is swimming with him; should be content to remain
near the shore if she so desire, and, in surf-bathing,
should lift her over the breakers, or try to shield
her from their force.</p>

<p>In teaching others to swim, infinite patience, good
temper and tact are needful. Allow for the nervousness
and awkwardness which are the almost inseparable
attributes of beginners.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">DRIVING AND RIDING</div>

<p>In driving always ask your companion if she or
he would prefer to handle the reins. Do not, by
bursts of speed, or by “fights” with a fractious
horse, endanger the safety or composure of your
guest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In riding horseback, never remain mounted when
addressing some friend who is on foot. If your
initial salute is to be followed by any conversation,
dismount and remain on foot until you take your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
leave. In helping a girl to the saddle, extend your
hand that she may place her left foot in the palm,
and on the same instant that you raise the hand she
will spring into the saddle; always adjust the curb
and snaffle, hand them to her and arrange her riding-habit
before you mount your own horse.</p>

<p>Cross-saddle riding for women is now so common
that it is generally accepted. Still a girl who
makes a visit where she expects to ride should make
sure her hostess approves this method before she
adopts it. Those who hold that a lady should use a
side-saddle feel strongly on the subject.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">GOOD BREEDING IN GAMES</div>

<p>There are countless pitfalls for the unwary in all
forms of sport; but none that can not be readily
bridged by consideration for others, by good temper,
and by the commonest rules of breeding. One general
rule for all sports and games is, do not take part
unless you can play reasonably well. To do so
otherwise is sure to embarrass you and to interfere
with the pleasure of others.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX<br />

<small>MRS. NEWLYRICH AND HER SOCIAL DUTIES</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">WE have ridiculed our newly-rich woman’s
fads, pretensions and failures so sharply
and for so long that we find it hard to do justice
to the solid virtues she often possesses. The average
specimen is fair game, and we—one and all,
from the gentlest to the most sarcastic—unite in
“setting her down.”</p>

<p>Except perhaps the mother-in-law, no other woman
supplies fun-makers with such abundant—and
cheap—material. She might retaliate on her persecutors
more frequently than she does by attributing
much of the ridicule, fine and coarse, heaped on her,
to envy, far meaner than the meanest of her pretensions.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus much for the average specimen at her worst.
The exceptions to the ignoble parvenu are numerous
enough to form a class by themselves. It is not
a disgrace in this country of dizzying down-sittings
and bewildering uprisings, for miner, mechanic,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
merchant or manufacturer to make money fast. It
is to his credit when he insists that the girl who was
poorer than himself when they were married, and
who has kept him at his best physical and mental
estate ever since by wise management of their modest
household—making every dollar do the work of
a dollar-and-a-quarter while feeding and clothing
her family—should get the full benefit of his
changed fortunes. In house, furniture, clothing,
company, and what he names vaguely “a good time
generally,” he means that she shall ruffle it with the
bravest of her associates. He means also that these
associates shall be in accord with his means. And
the intention need not be in vain. A woman who
is by instinct a lady, and who is at all clever in observing
the little things she lacks and acquiring them,
will find herself “received” by as many delightful
people as she has time for. And inwardly she may
take courage from a witty woman’s remark, “I’d
as soon be the newly-rich as the always-poor.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">MR. NEWLYRICH</div>

<p>However, the odds are all against the chances that
our worthy money-maker himself will conform his
personal behavior to the new conditions. Husbands
of his type leave “all that sort of thing” to wives
and daughters, and make the social advancement
of these women harder thereby. Not the least formidable
obstacle in their upward journey is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
stubborn fact that “your father is quite impossible.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">SOCIAL POLISH</div>

<p>Men, as a whole, do not take polish readily. As
John Newlyrich did not wear a dress coat before he
was twenty-one he is seldom quite at ease in a
“swallow-tail” at forty. As a millionaire of fifty,
he rebels against the obligation to wear it to the
family dinner every evening in the week. If he has
read Dickens, which is hardly likely, he echoes Mrs.
Boffin’s “Lor’! let us be comfortable!” He butters a
whole slice of bread, using his knife trowel-wise,
and if busy talking of something that interests him
particularly, he lays the slice upon the cloth during
the troweling. He cuts up his salad, and makes
the knife a good second to a fork while eating fish.
Loyal to the memories of early life, he never gets
over the habit of speaking of dinner as “supper,”
and observes in conversation at a fashionable reception,
“As I was eating my dinner at noon to-day.”
In like absent-mindedness, he tucks his napkin into
his collar to protect the expanse of shirt-front exposed
by the low-cut waistcoat of his dress suit. He
says “sir,” to his equals, and addresses facetious
remarks to the butler, or draws the waitress into
conversation while meals are going on. Anxious
wife and despairing daughters are grateful if he
does not put his knife into his mouth when off-guard.</p>

<p>Trifles—are they? Not to the climbers who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
exercised thereby. They are gravel between the
teeth, and pebbles in the dainty foot-wear of Mrs.
Newlyrich. The history of her social struggles
would be incomplete without the mention of this
drawback. <i>She</i> has learned the by-laws of social
usage by heart, and, loving and loyal wife though
she is, she sometimes loses patience with John for
not doing the same.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">PROPER SOCIAL ASPIRATION</div>

<p>In this, and in many another perplexity, more or
less grievous, our heroine has our sympathy and
deserves our respect. We use the word “heroine”
advisedly. We have put the wealthy pushing vulgarian,
who is part of the stock company of caricature
and joke-wright, entirely out of the question.
She has her sphere and her reward. Our
business is with the woman of worthy aspirations
and innate refinement, raised by a whirl of fortune’s
wheel from decent poverty to actual wealth. She
has a natural desire to mingle on equal terms with
the better sort of rich people. She is glad of her
wealth, but not purse-proud. It has introduced
her to another world. Of her social life it may be
truly said that old things have passed away and
all things have become new. It would be phenomenal
if she fitted at once and easily into it. Money
has bought her fine house, and for money the artistic
upholsterer has furnished it. Money has hired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
a staff of servants, whereas up to now, a maid-of-all-work
was her sole “help.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">ELEGANCE IN SPEECH</div>

<p>Money does not enable her to master the “shibboleth”
that would be her passport to the land she
would possess. And to mangle it into “sibboleth”—as
the least sophisticated of us know—means social
slaughter at the passages of Jordan. One’s speech
and manner of speaking are of the first importance
socially, and fortunately it is not difficult to improve
them if one earnestly determines to do so. One
may frankly take private lessons, or one may learn
much by listening closely to the talk of people of
high social finish. One should not, however, imitate
slavishly or attempt the impossible. To use the
“broad a” gracefully one must either have been born
to it or assiduously trained in one’s younger days.
Otherwise it is bound to seem an affectation. An
error heard with surprising frequency even from
well-educated people is the use of “don’t” for
“doesn’t.”</p>

<p>In <i>Sesame and Lilies</i> Ruskin remarks, “A false
accent or a mistaken syllable is enough in the parliament
of any civilized nation, to assign a man to
a certain degree of inferior standing forever.” This
is an extreme statement, of course, but there is
much truth in it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One thing Mrs. Newlyrich sometimes mistakenly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
permits is the correcting of her grammatical blunders
and her husband’s by their better-educated children.
To allow this shows a wrong sense of proportion.
It is infinitely more important for a child
to respect his parents and to show them respect than
that the laws of Lindley Murray be observed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AS TO FOREIGN PHRASES</div>

<p>Seldom use a foreign phrase even if you have perfectly
mastered its meaning and pronunciation. The
“well of English undefiled” is usually sufficient for
all needs. People who constantly sprinkle their
conversation and letters with “dictionary” French
or Latin lay themselves open to the charge of affectation.
Certain foreign words once accorded their
original pronunciation are now habitually Anglicized.
One of the commonest of these is “valet,”
which is now spoken as if it were an ordinary English
word.</p>

<p>Engage no servant who patronizes you. Give
your maids to understand at the outset that you are
the head of the house, and know perfectly well what
you want each one to do, and how your household
is to be run. Be kind with all—familiar with none.
They are your severest critics. Never speak to
them of your husband by his Christian name. Your
daughter should be “Miss Mary” and your son
“Master John” in this connection.</p>

<p>“Breakfast is on,” “Luncheon is ready,” “Dinner
is served” are the correct formulas that you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
should require at the announcement of a meal. Assert
yourself with dignity, never defiantly. Your
servants have nothing to do with your past, or with
anything connected with your personal history beyond
the present relation existing between you and
them. They will discuss and criticize you below-stairs
and on “evenings out,” and, in the event of
“changing their place,” to the next mistress who will
stoop to listen to them. They would do the same
were you a princess with a thousand-year-old pedigree.
Stand in your lot and be philosophical.</p>

<p>You can not be too punctilious in not questioning
them about how “things” were done in other houses
in which they have been employed. Every such
query will be construed into ignorance and diffidence.
Be a law unto yourself and unto them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">WORDS TO BE AVOIDED</div>

<p>Learn to speak of your “maid” or “maids,” not of
your “girl.” If you have two, call one the cook and
the other the housemaid. “Girl” is in itself a perfectly
good word but it has, like some other good
words as “genteel,” become debased by getting into
indifferent company. In referring to your family
avoid the word “folks” which has been decreed inelegant.
Substitute “folk” or “people.” Do not
overwork the word “lady,”—never speak of a
“saleslady,” though this does not mean that any
particular girl or woman serving behind a shop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
counter may not be a lady in every essential of the
word. Train yourself in the nice distinctions that
dictate when one shall say “woman” or “lady,” when
“man” and when “gentleman.” The terms “lady
friend” or “gentleman friend” are never to be used.
Never say “Excuse <i>me!</i>” Leave that to the person
who calls herself a “saleslady.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">SOCIAL AWKWARDNESS</div>

<p>Yet you must learn how the people live whom you
would meet upon common ground as old to them as
it is new to you. You blush in confessing that you
are bewildered as to the order in which the various
forks are to be used that lie beside your plate at the
few state dinners you attend. Entrées are many,
and some appallingly unfamiliar. You wonder
mutely what these people would think of you if
they knew that you were never “taken in” to dinner
by a man until to-night, and how narrowly you
watch the hostess, or the woman across the way
before you dare advance upon the course set before
you. Dreading awkward stiffness that would betray
preoccupation, you attract attention by a show
of gaiety unlike your usual behavior and unsuited
to time and place. Should you make a mistake—such
as using a spoon instead of the ice-cream fork—you
are abashed to misery. Don’t apologize, however
gross the solecism! In eighteen times out of
twenty, nobody has noticed the misadventure. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
twenty cases out of a score, if it were observed you
are the one person who would care a picayune about
it, or ever think of it again.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another cardinal principle is to learn to consider
yourself as a minute fractional part of society. When
your name is bawled out by usher or footman at a
large party, it sounds like the trump of doom in your
unaccustomed ears. To your excited imagination
all eyes are riveted upon you. In point of fact, you
are of no more consequence to the eyes, ears and
minds of your fellow guests than the carpet that
seems to rise to meet your uncertain feet. Stubborn
conviction of your insignificance is the first step that
counts in the acquisition of well-mannered composure
among your fellows.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">MAKING ACQUAINTANCES</div>

<p>In forming new acquaintances, be courteous in the
reception of advances, and slow in making them until
you have reason to think that you are liked for
yourself, and not because your husband represents
six, or it may be seven numerals. There are sure to
be dozens of critics who will accuse you of parading
these figures, as vessels fly bunting in entering a
strange harbor. Stamp on your mind that adventitious
circumstance has nothing to do with the worth
of <span class="smcap">YOU, YOURSELF</span>!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For a long while after you embark upon your new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
life, be watchful and studious—yet covertly, lest your
study be noted. Return calls promptly, sending in
the right number of cards, and bearing yourself in
conversation with gentle self-possession. Never be
flattered by any attention into a flutter of pleasure.
Above all, do not be obsequious, be the person who
honors you by social notice a multi-millionaire, or
the Chief Magistrate of these United States. Servility
is invariably vulgarity. Familiarity is, if possible,
a half-degree more repulsive. Self-respect and
a wholesome oblivion of dollars and cents are a
catholicon amid the temptations of your novel sphere.</p>

<p>If you chance to entertain some one who is still
as obscure as you were once yourself, avoid all temptation
to make a display or to be patronizing. “I am
so glad you could come to-night,” effusively commented
such a hostess to one of her guests. “I know
you go out so seldom!” The guest in question
showed by her silence that she did not relish being
publicly reminded that she was of limited social
opportunities.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">AVOID NOVELTIES</div>

<p>When you begin to entertain in your turn avoid,
scrupulously, startling effects and novelties of all
kinds. Until you are used to the task, be strictly
conventional in arrangements for your guests’ reception
and pleasure. Let floral decorations and
“souvenirs” be modest and tasteful. Mantels banked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
with orchids, boutonnières of hothouse roses at a
dollar apiece, and cases of expensive jewelry as
favors, may express a generous hospitality on your
part and a desire to gratify the acquaintances you
would convert into friends. They will surely be set
down to ostentatious display of means that few of
the guests possess.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">HELP FROM BOOKS</div>

<p>There are manuals of etiquette which will keep
you from open solecisms in social usages. Follow
their rules obediently, curbing all disposition to
originality—for a while, at least. If possible, keep
the greedy society reporter at a distance, without
angering her. Do not give away the list of those
invited, much less the menu. As Dick Fanshawe’s
eulogist said of men who “jump upon their mothers,”—“Some
does, you know!” Some even send
in to the newspapers unsolicited descriptions of their
entertainments with lists of guests, to the amusement
of the editorial office.</p>

<p>These mistakes give occasion to the aforementioned
cartoonists and joke-venders to deride the
name of hospitality dispensed by the Newlyrich clan.
Let the aforesaid manual of etiquette be followed
with obedience, but not with servile and unthinking
obedience. Unfortunately, it is true that the person
unaccustomed to precise social regulations and to a
formal manner of living, is inclined to consider the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
rules governing such life as arbitrary, inexplicable
and mysterious. If the uninitiated woman will disabuse
herself of this idea, she has taken a long step
in the right direction. Once you accept the fact
that there is reason behind the forms employed by
society, it will not be long before you will be searching
for the reason itself. The laws governing the
conventional world will then acquire for you a meaning
that will make adherence to them simple and
natural, instead of stiff and mechanical.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">LEARN TO DISCRIMINATE</div>

<p>The matter of discriminating properly in questions
of taste is a thing much more difficult to learn
than the set and definite rules governing definite
exigencies of social life. Yet taste,—taste in
clothes, taste in the objects surrounding one, taste
in all matters with which expenditure is concerned,—this
is a necessity in the attainment of any social
position worthy of the name. In this direction
something may be gained by observation, though
not until the eye is sufficiently trained to make it a
trustworthy guide. The sense of beauty is somewhat
a matter of cultivation, and its application to
every-day life is the result of experience and judgment.
Do not imagine that a color is becoming to
you merely because you happen to like it. Do not
buy a chair or a couch simply because the one or the
other may happen to please your fancy. The color<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
you wear, the furniture you buy must have reference,
the one to your appearance, the other to its
surroundings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CONSULTING AUTHORITIES</div>

<p>When one is unversed in these matters it is best
to submit problems to an authority. It is wiser to
allow a clever modiste to select the color, style and
material of one’s gown than to do it one’s self. It
is better to put the scheme of decoration for your
house into the hands of some accomplished person,
educated to that end, than to attempt it yourself.
In large cities persons competent in this matter of
household decoration may easily be found, people
whose business it is to act as paid agents of the
more beautiful and esthetic way. Many architects
have in their employ persons who are capable of advising
as to interior decoration and of superintending
the work. If one is resident in a small place,
the difficulty is obviated by the intelligent aid offered
to the questioner through the columns of the
better magazines devoted to esthetics as applied to
every-day living. The advice given in the best of
these publications is conscientious, careful, expert
advice.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One especial point in house-furnishing is worth
noting. Do not crowd your beautiful Oriental rugs
together, but leave a surface of polished floor about
each. Rugs are floor pictures and should have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
frames as well as wall pictures do. The effect of
putting them close upon one another, though seen in
many houses otherwise well ordered, is inartistic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AS TO LION-HUNTING</div>

<p>Mrs. Newlyrich is frequently criticized for her
frequent fondness for lion-hunting. This is not
always fair. If she hunt because of the glory she
hopes to heap on herself, she deserves ridicule, but
if she do it in the spirit of genuine appreciation and
a desire to give rare pleasure to her friends she performs
a real service to art and to society and merits
praise for her courage and kindness, not censure.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If the woman who is now wealthy was once a
trained nurse or a stenographer, do not let her be
ashamed of the fact now. If she is frank and simple
about the matter, sensible people will respect her
for having been honorably employed. If she tries
to hide the truth, every one will despise her for it.
If she avoid the phrase—and the thought back of it—so
often heard, “getting into society,” and will remember
that all gentle aspiring persons are already
members of the best society, she will be helped to
steer her bark aright.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Beware of any person who attempts to exploit
you “for revenue only.” On the other hand, if you
find some one who for reasons of sincere liking undertakes
to show you the social ropes, you will be
fortunate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE VALUE OF MODESTY</div>

<p>I have said that it is not your fault that you were
not born in the purple. Neither is it of your merit
and to your honor that you now walk in silk attire,
and may freely gratify dreams you would once have
considered wildly impossible. A certain steadiness
of attitude should be striven for. Don’t be like a bell,
answering helplessly to every contact. Imitate in
your manner that large nobility of Horatio of whom
Hamlet said,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">

<div class="verse">“A man that fortune’s buffets and rewards</div>
<div class="verse">Hast ta’en with equal thanks.</div>
<div class="verse">They are not a pipe for fortune’s finger</div>
<div class="verse">To sound what stop she please.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The best of all books enjoins on the suddenly-exalted
to be mindful of the pit from whence they
were digged. Purse-pride is contemptible in its
meanness and folly. You are safe from ridicule if
you keep this fact in mind. Set up “me” and “mine”
in “pearl” type, and not in capitals.</p>

<p>A final injunction: do not assume knowledge of
what you are really ignorant. To do this is to lay
traps for yourself and to multiply embarrassments.
Try to forestall the situation by private questioning;
if you can not do this say frankly that you do not
know.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX<br />

<small>DELICATE POINTS FOR OUR GIRL</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THIS chapter is, perhaps, rather a <i>Familiar Talk
with Our Girl</i> on the proprieties—which she
may not recognize as such—than the emphasizing of
various points of etiquette. But the violation of
the essentials of self-respect is so common that a
book of this character should have a chapter devoted
to a bit of plain speaking to the young woman of
to-day. We may call her actions, under certain
circumstances, a violation of the proprieties, or of
etiquette, or of conventionality. Or, perhaps, it is
a sin against all three.</p>

<p>We are accustomed to seeing the sign “Hands
off!” hung upon dainty fabrics,—pure spotless materials
that would be injured and stained by the
touching of a gloved or bare hand. People who
admire the pure beauty of the article thus marked
do not resent the sign. They see the wisdom of it
and are willing to obey the mandate. For a fabric
once soiled never looks the same again. All the
chemicals in the country can not give it the peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
pristine freshness that was once its chief beauty.</p>

<p>To those who appreciate the beauty of youth, its
pure freshness, the thought of its being touched by
indiscriminate hands is abhorrent.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KEEPING A MAN’S RESPECT</div>

<p>We have, happily, passed the Lydia Languish
age, the day in which the young girl was a fragile
creature, given to fainting and hysterics, clothed
in innocence that was ignorance, good because she
was afraid to be naughty, or because she was so
hedged in by conventionalities that she did not have
the opportunity to stray near the outer edge of the
pasture bars. In her place we have a healthy, fearless,
clear-eyed young person, looking life and its
possibilities square in the face, good because she
knows from observation or hearsay what evil is,
and abhors it because it is evil. She is a sister, a
chum, a jolly companion to the boy or man with
whom she associates. She rides, walks, golfs or
dances with him. She may do, and she does, all
these things, and she still keeps his respect.</p>

<p>Thus far we go, and then creeps in the sinister
question: Does she always do this?</p>

<p>The answer comes promptly: It is her own fault
if she loses any man’s respect.</p>

<p>To those of us who have outstepped girlhood,
who have begun to live deeply these lives of ours
that are full of potentialities for good or evil, there
comes a keen insight, and, with that insight, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
outer sight becomes more clear; and, sometimes, in
looking at young people, we find our hearts, and
almost our lips, crying out, “<span class="smcap">Don’t!</span>”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BLOOM OF THE PEACH</div>

<p>We would not be—we are not—prudes, but the
bloom of the peach is beautiful, and once rubbed
off it can not be replaced. The snow-white fabric
is too fair to be carelessly handled.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE RESPONSIBILITY OF GIRLS</div>

<p>Last winter I sat in a train-seat behind a girl of
eighteen and a young man a few years her senior.
She was pretty and bright. She chatted gaily with
her companion, who, after a few minutes, threw
his arm over the back of her seat. To the initiated,
it was evidently done as a trial as to whether that
kind of thing would be allowed. The girl, intent
on the conversation, appeared not to notice the
action. In a few moments the hand resting against
the girl’s shoulder was laid over the shoulder. The
owner flushed, made some laughing protest, but evidently
administered no rebuke, as the offending
member continued to rest where it was, then gradually
crept up toward her neck; finally, at some
teasing remark of hers, it tweaked her ear. Had
the child been older, the look in the man’s eyes,
as he watched the fluctuations of color in her pretty
face, would have warned her that she was playing
with fire; that his respect for her would have been
greater had she shown in the beginning that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
sign, “Hands off!” was on her person, although invisible
to the vulgar eye.</p>

<p>This is but one of the many instances of the free-and-easy
actions on the part of men, permitted by
well-meaning girls.</p>

<p>In nine hundred and ninety-nine cases out of a
thousand a man will not take a liberty with a girl
unless she allows it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IS BERNARD SHAW RIGHT?</div>

<p>I wish girls would bear this fact in mind! Men
are what they make them, what they allow them to
be. When a young fellow told a man in my presence
last week that such and such a girl was a
“jolly sort,” and, while out driving, had stopped at
a roadhouse with him, gone into the parlor of the
house and taken a glass of ginger ale while he had
one of whisky, I was not surprised that the man
of the world to whom he imparted this fact, remarked,
“Crookéd, eh?”</p>

<p>That the young fellow (who, had he been older
or less easily flattered, would not have related the
occurrence) flushed and laughingly denied the allegation—did
not alter the fact that the conclusion
drawn was inevitable. The young girl may not,
probably did not, deserve the stricture passed on
her, but by her free-and-easy behavior she lost
something she never can regain.</p>

<p>Men may pay attention to girls who ignore the
conventionalities, who allow them doubtful liberties,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
but they like them because they are what they term
“fun.” Such girls are not those for whom men live,
for whom they sacrifice bad habits, for whom they
look in seeking a wife, and for whom they would
bravely give up life if necessary. The true love of
a good man is worth winning. It is not won by
the girl who lowers herself in a man’s eyes. To
her might apply the time-worn toast of man to
“The New Woman,—once our superior, now our
equal.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another point to which I would draw the attention
of our girl is that the man should make the advances,
should do the seeking and the courting. To
this she would reply, “Why, of course! All girls
know that.” They may know it theoretically, but
does every girl live up to that knowledge? Does
she always wait to be sought, to be won, without
taking a hand herself at assisting destiny? I think
observation will not prove that she does.</p>

<p>In this very free-and-easy age, when men are too
busy seeking the elusive mighty dollar to be over-eager
to show marked attention to girls, it is often
the young woman who pays heed to some of the
preliminaries of the courting period. It is frequently
she who suggests to a man, after meeting him several
times, that she would be glad to have him call.
It is she who, when he is going on a journey, asks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
him if he will not write to her. It is she who asks
him for his picture and, on occasion, offers him one
of hers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">KEEPING ONE’S SELF-RESPECT</div>

<p>It is, and it has been through centuries, the place
of the man to take the initiative in such matters.
If he wants to call on a girl, let him, as a rule, have
the courage to ask her if he may do so; if he wishes
to correspond with her, he should ask her permission
to write to her. And if he does none of these
things of his own volition, they may go undone.
The girl who, through love of admiration, or the
desire for men’s attention, takes these initial steps,
loses her self-respect, and, unless the man in question
be an exceptional instance, awakens in his
breast a sensation of amused interest. He is flattered,
and a bit contemptuous. As time goes on
and he likes the girl more and more, that feeling
may be forgot, but it is always lying there dormant,
and may arise sometime just when the young
woman would most wish for respect and love.</p>

<p>Men prize that which they have had difficulty in
winning. The apple that drops, over-ripe, at one’s
feet is never quite so tempting as that which hangs
just beyond reach.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is well for the matter of sex to be put out of
mind in many of the dealings between young men
and young women, but in the question of loverly attentions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
it can not be ignored. And in this matter
it is the man, and the man only, who should make
advances. It is better for her peace of mind that a
girl should never have the marked attention of any
man, than that she should forget her maidenly dignity
in order to acquire it. Such acquisition is certainly
not worth the price paid for it.</p>

<p>A man must look up to that which he loves. And
a hard-and-fast rule is the slangy one that declares
that one does not run after a car when he has already
caught it, or when it stands at the corner waiting
for him, and ready to start or stand at his will.
The girls for whom men find life worth living are
those who are ideals as well as companions.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HANDS OFF</div>

<p>Dear girls, be happy, be merry, have all the harmless
fun that the good God, who wishes you to be
happy, sends your way. But for the sake of the
man who may one day seek you and win you—for
the sake of the womanhood that he would honor—let
all men know that you are labeled—“<span class="smcap">HANDS
OFF!</span>” and that you are not to be cheaply gained.
They will love you better, respect and honor you
more for that knowledge.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A serious mistake often made by girl students
and working girls is taking the men who call on
them to their rooms. In most cases these rooms are
fitted up with couches to look much like sitting-rooms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
but the men know they are <i>not</i> sitting-rooms,
and the girl who receives men thus suffers for it in
name if not in fact. It is a thing that a self-respecting
girl can not afford to do, even once. If
she expects to have men call on her, she must choose
a room in a house where she may occasionally have
the use of a parlor. The ruling may seem hard, but
there is no getting round it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No young girl can afford to accept a luncheon or
dinner invitation from a married man or, indeed,
any attention whatsoever. It does not matter that
he may be an “old friend of the family,”—those who
see her may not know this and, even if they do, may
not acquit her of harm. For similar seasons, a girl
employed as secretary in a man’s office should take
care that the relation between her and her employer
is purely one of business.</p>

<div class="sidenote">GOOD TASTE IN JEST</div>

<div class="sidenote">DELICACY IN CONVERSATION</div>

<p>One of the unfailing tests of good breeding is
what one laughs at. Without becoming priggish, a
girl should discriminate between what is a fit subject
for jest and what is entitled to her reverence.
As a rule, jests about birth, death and marriage are
to be avoided. A special word of suggestion must
be given in connection with the first of these subjects.
If you are to speak of a woman who is to
become a mother, say frankly that she is expecting
or bearing a child. The euphemisms employed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
place of this plain phrase are unspeakably vulgar.
It is never vulgar to be frank if the person and the
circumstances justify the introduction of the subject
at all. One must often wish for more of the old-fashioned
reserve on intimate topics. A critic of
modern women said of them recently: “Among
themselves, women lose more delicacy than any man
could take from them.” When one listens aghast to
the talk of some modern women, one can but echo
the statement. Akin to this unbecoming freedom
of speech is the lack of consideration sometimes
shown to an expectant mother by her friends. Comment
in such instances one would suppose would be
recognized as the height of indelicacy, but thoughtlessly,
and in a spirit of jest, remarks are made that
cause a sensitive person to wince. Unless the
mother-to-be confides her sacred expectations, she
has every right to have them treated with the respect
of silence, and only a vulgar-minded woman
will intrude upon her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI<br />

<small>OUR OWN AND OTHER PEOPLE’S CHILDREN</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">CONSTANCE FENIMORE WOOLSON, in
one of her novels, thus describes a discourtesy
to which mothers of young children are much given:</p>

<p>“Talking with a mother when her children are
in the room is the most trying thing conversationally;
she listens to you with one ear, but the other
is listening to Johnnie; right in the midst of something
very pathetic you are telling her she will give
a sudden, perfectly irrelevant smile over her baby’s
last crow, and your best story is hopelessly spoiled
because she loses the point (although she pretends
she hasn’t) while she arranges the sashes of Ethel
and Totsie.”</p>

<p>There is a protest in the paragraph quoted that
will find an answering groan in many a heart. Who
of us does not wish that mothers of small children
would adopt a few rules of ordinary politeness and
courtesy, and, when talking to a guest, give attention
that is not shared and almost monopolized by
the child who happens to be present?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SMALL BOY</div>

<p>Parents make the mistake of thinking that their
children must be as absorbingly interesting to all
visitors and acquaintances as they are to those to
whom they belong. This is a vast mistake. No
matter how fond one may be of the young of his
species, one does enjoy a conversation into which
they are not dragged, and talks with more freedom
if they are not present. Certainly it is far better for
the child to learn to run off and amuse himself than
to sit by, listening to talk not meant for his ears.
Those of us who were children many years ago were
not allowed to make nuisances of ourselves to the
extent that children of to-day do, and surely we
were happy. In one home there is a small boy, very
good, and very affectionate, whose mother can not
receive a caller without the presence of the ubiquitous
infant. He sits still, his great eyes fixed upon
the face of the caller, and she feels ashamed for
wishing that he would get out of the room. Occasionally
he varies the monotony by saying,
“Mother, don’t you want to tell Mrs. Blank about
what I said the other day when I was hurt and did
not cry?” Or, “Mother, do you think Mrs. Blank
would like me to recite my new poem to her?”</p>

<p>This may be annoying, but it is still more pitiful.
To talk so much to a child and of him in the presence
of others that he is a poseur at the early age
of five, is cruel to the little one himself. We frown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
on the old adage which declared “children should
be seen and not heard,” but there are homes in which
the guest wishes that they might be invisible as well
as inaudible.</p>

<p>One mother defers constantly to her fourteen-year-old
son, and allows him to be present during
all chats she has with her friends. She says, “You
do not mind Will, I am sure. You may say what
you like where he is, for he is the soul of discretion,
and I talk freely with him.” But the visitor does
not feel the same confidence in “Will,” and certainly
objects to expressing all her opinions with
regard to people and things in his presence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OTHER PEOPLE’S CHILDREN</div>

<p>Our own children are intensely interesting; the
children of other people are, as a rule, <i>not!</i> Let us,
once in a while, put ourselves in the place of another
person, and think if we are willing to have that
person’s child always in the room when we would
talk confidentially with her. I think if we are frank
we shall acknowledge that while we do not mind
the presence of our own children, we do talk more
freely when other people’s children are not present.
Said a man not long ago:</p>

<p>“Mrs. Brown is a marvelous woman. She is one
of the most devoted mothers I know. Her children
are with her a great part of the time. Yet, whenever
I call there, alone or with a friend, a signal
from her empties the drawing-room or library of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
the entire flock of five infants, and she is just as
much interested in what her callers have to say as
if she had no youngsters cruising about in the offing.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">TRAINING THE SHY CHILD</div>

<p>It is not to be supposed that children are never
to be allowed to come into the drawing-room. They
should be trained to enter the room, greet the guests
politely and without embarrassment, answer frankly
and straightforwardly, and to speak when spoken to.
Then, they should be silent unless drawn into the
conversation. The truest kindness is, after a few
moments, to let the little ones run away and play
with their toys or in the outdoor air.</p>

<p>The child who hangs his head shyly, and refuses
to speak politely to any one who addresses him,
should be taught the courtesy of friendliness. From
the cradle a baby may be taught to “see people,”
and, as soon as he is old enough to return a greeting,
he must be trained to do so.</p>

<p>The only way to make small ladies and gentlemen
of children is to teach, first of all, perfect obedience.
This is, in this day, an unpopular doctrine,
for there is prevalent a theory that the child must be
allowed to exercise his individuality,—in other
words, to do as he pleases. Why the child should
develop his individuality, and the parents curb theirs,
may be matter for wonder to those not educated up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
to this twentieth-century standard of ethics. If
“days should speak, and multitude of years should
teach wisdom,” the father and mother are better
fitted to dictate to the child than the child to dictate
to them. And yet, in the average home, the last-mentioned
form of government often prevails.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FIRMNESS IN CONTROL</div>

<p>Nothing is more unkind than to allow a child to
do always as he pleases, for, as surely as he lives,
he must learn sooner or later to yield to authority
and to exercise self-control. The earlier the training
begins, the easier it will be. The child creeping
about the room soon knows that the gentle but firm
“No!” when spoken by the mother means that he
must not touch the bit of bric-à-brac within reach.
And even this lesson will stand him in good stead
later on.</p>

<p>The basic principle of home government must be
love enforced by firmness. A punishment should
seldom be threatened, but if threatened, must be
given. The time for threat and punishment is not
in public. In the parlor, on the train or boat, it
is the height of ill-breeding to make a scene and to
threaten a punishment of any kind. Were the child
properly trained in private, parents and beholders
would be spared the humiliating spectacle that too
often confronts them in visiting and traveling.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One word here as to the child on train or boat.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
The person who is truly well-bred will not turn and
frown on the mother of the tiny baby who, suffering
with colic, or sore from traveling, is wailing
aloud. Of course the sound is annoying, but it is
harder on the poor mortified mother than on any
one else. I already hear the question, “Why doesn’t
she keep the infant at home then?” Frequently
she can not do this. The child may be ill, and be
on its way to seashore or mountains to gain health;
or the mother may be summoned to see some relative,
and can not go unless the baby goes too.
Whatever the cause of her going, the fact remains
that she derives no pleasure from holding a screaming
baby, and her discomfort is turned into positive
anguish by the disgusted looks of the women, and
the muttered imprecations of the men.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A KINDLY TRAVELER</div>

<p>I saw once under such circumstances a woman
who was an honor to her sex. Opposite her in the
train sat a young mother, and in her arms was a
fretful wailing baby. It was evidently the first
baby, and the poor girlish mother was white and
weary. At every scream the baby gave she would
start nervously, change the little one’s position, look
about at the passengers with an expression of pathetic
apology,—all the time keeping up a crooning
“Sh-h-h!” that produced no effect on the crying
atom of humanity. And, as is often the case, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
more nervous the mother became, the more nervous
did the baby grow, and the louder did he scream.
An exclamation of impatience came from a woman
seated behind the suffering twain, and, at the same
moment, a man in front threw down his paper with
a slam and rushed out of the car and into the smoker.
Then the woman who was an honor to her sex came
across from the seat opposite, and laid a gentle
hand on the mother’s shoulder, smiling reassurance
in the tear-filled eyes lifted to hers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TRUE COURTESY</div>

<p>“My dear,” said the soft voice, “you are worn
out, and the baby knows it. Let me take him for
a minute. No, don’t protest! I have had four of
my own, and they are all too big for me to hold
in my arms now. I just <i>long</i> to feel that baby
against my shoulder! Give him to me! There,
now! you poor, tired little mother, put your head
down on the back of the seat, and rest!”</p>

<p>She took the baby across the aisle, laid him over
her shoulder with his head against her cheek, in the
comforting way known to all baby-lovers, and in
three minutes the cries had subsided and the baby
was asleep in the strong motherly arms, where he
lay until Jersey City was reached. And the tired
little mother fell into a light slumber, too, comforted
by the appreciation that she was not alone, nor an
intolerable nuisance to all her fellow passengers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>

<p>Was not such an act as this woman’s the perfection
of true courtesy, the courtesy that forgets itself
in trying to make another comfortable?</p>

<div class="sidenote">TEACHING GOOD MANNERS</div>

<p>This same spirit spoken of by Saint Paul as “in
honor preferring one another” can be inculcated in
the children in our homes. The small of the human
species are, like their elders, naturally selfish, and
must be taught consideration for others. It is the
grafting that makes the rose what it is. You may
graft a Jacqueminot or Maréchal Neil upon the
stump of the wild rose. The grafting, the pruning,
and the training are the work of the careful gardener.
The mother can never be idle, for, while the
stock is there, she does the grafting.</p>

<p>Obedience must be taught in small things as well
as in great. The tiny child must be taught to remove
his hat when he is spoken to, to give his hand
readily in greeting, to say “please” and “thank you”;
not to pass in front of people, or between them and
the fire; to say “excuse me!” when he treads on
his mother’s foot or dress; to rise when she enters
the room; and to take off his hat when he kisses her.
The mother who insists that her child do these things
at home need not fear that he will forget her training
when abroad.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII<br />

<small>OUR NEIGHBORS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE fact that people live next door to you
does not make them your neighbors in the
higher and better sense of that word. There may
be nothing in their persons or characters to commend
them to you, or for that matter, to commend
you to them. “Neighborhood” in literal interpretation
signifies nearness of vicinity. You have the
right to choose your associates and to elect your
friends.</p>

<p>Presuming on this truth, dwellers in cities are
prone to vaunt their ignorance of, and indifference
to, those who live in the same street, block and
apartment-house with themselves. If newly come to
what is a kingdom by comparison with their former
estate, they make a point of seeking society elsewhere
than among residents of their neighborhood.
“Let us be genteel or die!” says Dickens of Mrs.
Fielding’s struggles to eat dinner with gloves on.
“Let us be exclusive or cease to live!” says Mrs. Upstart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
and refuses to learn the names of her neighbors
on the right and left.</p>

<p>One of the hall-marks of the thoroughbred is his
daily application of the maxim, “Live and let live.”
His social standing is so firm that a jostle, or even
a push from a vulgarian who chances to pass his
way, can not disturb him. When the mongrel cur
bayed at the moon, “the moon kept on shining.” If
he be a gentleman in heart as well as in blood and
name, he has a real interest in people who breathe
the same air and tread the same street with himself—interest
as far removed from vulgar curiosity
in other people’s concerns as the gentle courtesy of
his demeanor is removed from the familiar bumptiousness
of the forward and underbred.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">CHANCE SALUTATIONS</div>

<p>Entering ourselves as learners in his school—and
we could not study manners in a better—we recognize
our neighbors as such. If we live on the same
block and meet habitually on the street, a civil bow
in passing, a smile to a child, in chance encounters
in market or shop, a word of salutation, be it only
a “Good morning,” or “It is a fine day!” or, after
a few exchanges of this sort—“I hope your family
keeps well in this trying weather”—are tokens of
good-will and appreciation of the fact that we are
dwellers in the same world, town and neighborhood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COURTEOUS INQUIRIES</div>

<p>None of these minute courtesies which you owe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
to yourself and to your neighbor lays on you any
obligation to call, or to invite her to call on you.
Failure to comprehend this social by-law often causes
heart-burnings and downright resentment. You
may thus meet and greet a woman living near you
every day for twenty years, and if some stronger
bond than the accident of proximity does not draw
you together, you may know nothing more of her
than her name and address at the end of that time—perhaps
the address alone. Unless, indeed, casualty
in the way of fire, personal injury or severe
illness, makes expedient—and to the humane such
expediency is an obligation—further recognition of
the tie of neighborhood. In either of the cases indicated,
send to ask after the health of the sufferer,
and if you can be of service. If there be a death
in the house, a civil inquiry to the same effect and
a card of sympathy will “commit” you to nothing.</p>

<p>We are working now on the assumption that each
of us has a sincere desire to brighten the pathway
of others, to make this hard business of daily living
more tolerable. Of all the passive endurances of
life, strangerhood is one of the hardest to the sensitive
spirit. Your neighbor’s heart is lighter because
you show that you are aware of her existence
and, in some sort, recognize her identity. She may
not be your congener. Your bow and smile remind
her that you are her fellow human being. Stranger</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>ships meeting in mid-ocean do not wait to inspect
credentials before exchanging salutes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If your neighbor be an acquaintance whom you
esteem, do not let her be in doubt on this point.</p>

<div class="sidenote">IN PLANTATION DAYS</div>

<p>In ante-bellum days at the South, neighborhood
was a powerful bond of sympathy. Miles meant less
to them in this respect than so many squares mean
to us now. A system of wireless telegraphy connected
plantations for an area of many miles. Joy
or sorrow set the current in motion from one end
to the other. What I have called elsewhere being
“kitchenly-kind,” was comprehended in perfection
in that bygone time. When the house-mother sent
a pot of preserves to her neighbor with her love,
and “she would like to know how you all are to-day,”
it was the outward and substantial sign of the
inward grace of loving kindness, and not an intimation
that the recipient’s preserve-closet was not
so well-stocked as the giver’s. When opened
hamper and unfolded napkin showed a quarter of
lamb, or a steak, or a roll of home-made “sausage
meat,” enough neighborly love garnished the gift to
make it beautiful.</p>

<p>Out-of-fashion nowadays?</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“’Tis true: ’tis true ’tis pity;</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And pity ’tis ’tis true.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE BEST PEOPLE</div>

<p>Enough of the old-time spirit lives among our
really “best people” to justify the “kitchenly-kind”
in proffering gifts that presuppose personal liking
and active desire to please a neighbor. A cake compounded
by yourself; a plate of home-made rolls
taken from your own table; a dainty fancy dish of
sweets of home-manufacture, express more of the
“real thing” than a box of confectionery or a basket
of flowers put up by a florist. It is the personal
touch that glorifies the gift, the consciousness that
your neighbor thinks enough of you to give of her
time and service for your pleasure. The home-made
offering partakes of her individuality, and appeals
to yours.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Neighborliness does not, of necessity, imply familiarity
of manner and speech that may become
offensive, or a continuous performance of visits,
calls and “droppings-in” that must inevitably become
a bore, however congenial may be the association.
Those friendships last longest where certain
decorous forms are always observed, no matter how
close the mutual affection may be. Mrs. Stowe, in
one of her New England stories, describes the intercourse
between two families as “a sort of undress
intimacy.” Reading further, we find that this dishabille
companionship involves visits by way of the
back door and at all sorts of unconventional hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">BACK-DOOR VISITING</div>

<p>Such abandonment of the reserves that etiquette
enjoins on every household is a dangerous experiment.
The back porch is for family use. Your
next-door neighbor may not meddle therewith. Personally,
I do not want my own son, or my married
daughters, to enter my house through the kitchen.
If you, dear reader, would retain your footing
in the house of the friend best-loved by you, come
in by the front door, and never without announcing
your presence as any other visitor would. Steady
persistence in this rule will avoid the chances of
divers unpleasant possibilities. Your hostess—or
her husband—or grown son—may be as much in
dishabille as the intimacy which, in your opinion,
warrants you in running in and up, without knock
or ring. You may happen on a love-scene, or a
family quarrel, or a girl may be in the hands of the
treasure of a hair-dresser who shampoos her twice
a month with pure water that looks like peroxide
of hydrogen, and “restores” the subject’s dark
brown tresses to the guileless flaxen of her forgotten
babyhood; or your clattering heels upon the
stairway may break the touchy old grandmother’s
best afternoon nap.</p>

<p>There is but one place on earth where it is safe
to make yourself “perfectly at home,” and that is
your own house—or apartment—or chamber.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII<br />

<small>CHURCH AND PARISH</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THEORETICALLY, the church is a pure democracy,
a mighty family. There, if anywhere,
the rich and the poor meet together on terms
of absolute equality.</p>

<p>In that least poetical of pious jingles,—</p>

<p class="center">
“Blest be the tie that binds,”—<br />
</p>

<p class="unindent">we declare that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The fellowship of kindred minds</div>
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Is like to that above.”</span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>These and other Pietistic platitudes, whether
tame or tuneful, are technical, and so nearly meaningless
as not to provoke debate. Every reasonable
man and woman knows and does not affect to conceal
his or her consciousness of the truth that social
distinctions are not effaced by the enrolment of rich
and poor, educated and illiterate, refined and boorish,
in impartial order upon the “church books.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
True religion <i>does</i> refine feeling and engender benevolence
and charitable judgment of our fellows.
In doing this, it creates a common ground of sympathy,
as of belief. It elevates the moral and spiritual
nature. Of itself, it does not enrich the intellect,
or polish manners. One may have a clean heart
and dirty flesh-and-blood hands; may be a sincere
and earnest Christian, yet double his negatives,
shove his food into his mouth with his knife, prefer
the corner of a table-cloth to a napkin, and be an
alien in the matter of finger-bowls.</p>

<p>It is possible that two women may work together
harmoniously in church and parish associations, each
esteeming the other’s excellent qualities of heart and
enjoying the fellowship of her “kindred mind,” and
yet that both should be intensely uncomfortable if
forced into reciprocal social relations that have nothing
to do with church or charity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE REASONABLE VIEW</div>

<p>These are plain facts no reasonable person will
dispute. In view of them the fact, equally patent,
that the Newlyrich clan sometimes resort to church
connection as a lever to raise them to a higher social
plane, is one of the anomalies of human intercourse
that may well stir the satirist to bitter ridicule and
move compassionate beholders to wonder.</p>

<p>“When they begin to feel their oats they go off
to you!” laughed the keen-witted, sweet-natured
pastor of a down-town church to a brother clergyman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
whose flock worshiped in a finer building and
a fashionable neighborhood. “The sheep with the
golden fleece always finds a breach in our church-wall.”</p>

<p>It takes him, his ewe and his lambs, a long time
to learn that pew proximity does not bring about
social sympathy. It is not a week since I saw a girl,
a thoroughbred from crown to toe, flush in surprise
and draw herself up in unconscious hauteur, when
a flashily-dressed young person greeted her across
the vestibule of a concert-room with “Hello, Nellie!
didn’t we have a bully time last night?”</p>

<p>They had attended a Sunday-school anniversary,
and, as their classes were side by side, had exchanged
remarks in the intervals of recitations, songs and
addresses. The parvenu’s clothes were more costly
than “Nellie’s;” her father was richer; <i>they were
members of the same church!</i> To her vulgar mind
these circumstances gave her the right to take a
liberty with a slight acquaintance such as no well-bred
person would have dreamed of assuming.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">YOUR PEW NEIGHBOR</div>

<p>First, then, I place among the maxims of church
and parish etiquette: Do not imagine that your next-pew
neighbor must be your friend. If she be a
newcomer and a stranger in the congregation, bow
to her in meeting in lobby or in aisle cordially,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
recognizing her as a fellow worshiper in a temple
where all are welcome and equal. If you can be
of service to her in finding the place of hymn or
psalm, should she be at a loss, perform the neighborly
service tactfully and graciously,—always because
you are in the House of the All-Father, and are
His children,—not that you seek to court a mortal’s
favor for any ulterior purpose.</p>

<p>In meeting her on the street, let your salutation
be ready and pleasant, but not familiar. Don’t
“Hello, Nellie!” her, then or ever, while bearing
in mind that non-recognition of one you know to
be a regular attendant at the same church with yourself,
yet a comparative stranger there, is unkind and
un-Christian.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE STRANGER IN CHURCH</div>

<p>The case is different if you are the stranger.
Friendly advances should come from the other side.
If they are not made, there is nothing for you to
do but to content yourself with the recollection that
you go to church to worship God, not to make acquaintances.
Never depend on your church-connection
for society. If you find congenial associates
there, rejoice in the happy circumstance and make
the most of it. If you do not, do not rail at the
congregation as “stiff and stuck up,” at the church
as a hollow sham, and the pastor as an unfaithful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
shepherd. The expectation on the part of some people
that he should neglect the weightier matters of
the law and the gospel, and prostitute his holy office
by becoming a social pudding-stick for incorporating
into “a jolly crowd” the divers elements of those
to whom he is called to minister, disgraces humanity
and civilization—not to say Christianity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">PEW HOSPITALITY</div>

<p>Pew hospitality has fallen into disuse to a great
extent of late years, principally on account of the
usher-service. The tendency of this partial desuetude
is to make pew owners utterly careless of their
obligation to entertain strangers. Regard for the
best interests of your particular church-organization
should suggest to you as a duty that you notify
the usher in your aisle of your willingness to receive
strangers into your pews whenever the one or two
vacant seats there may be needed. If your family
fills them all every Sunday, you can not exercise the
grace of hospitality.</p>

<p>When one or two, or three, are to be absent from
either service, however, take the trouble to apprise
the oft-sorely-perplexed official of the fact, and give
him leave to bring to your door any one he has to
seat. When the stranger appears, let him see at
once that you esteem his coming a pleasure. Give
him a good seat, a book and a welcome generally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span></p>

<p>By this behavior you commend to his favor your
church, human nature and the cause dearest to your
heart.</p>

<p>If you are the visiting worshiper, and it is evident
that the other occupants of the pew are the
owners thereof, make courteous and grateful acknowledgment
at the close of the service, of the hospitality
you have received. I hope the return you
get will not be the cold supercilious stare one true
gentlewoman had from the holder of a pew in the
middle aisle of a fashionable church in New York.
The guest put into Mrs. Haut Ton’s pew thanked
the latter simply and gracefully for the opportunity
given her of hearing an admirable sermon.</p>

<p>“Who are you that dare address <i>me!</i>” said the
silent stare. “It is bad enough to have <i>my</i> pew invaded
by an unvouched-for stranger without being
subjected to the impertinence of speech!”</p>

<p>The last place upon God’s earth where incivility
and the arrogance of self-conceit are admissible is
His house. “Be pitiful,” writes the apostle who
learned his code of manners from One who has been
not irreverently called “the truest gentleman who
ever lived.” “Be pitiful; be courteous!”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE PASTOR’S FAMILY</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE PASTOR’S CALL</div>

<p>The relations of parishioner and the pastor’s
family are often strained hard by the popular misconception
of the social obligations existing—or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
that should exist—between them. In no “call” that
I ever heard of is the clergyman enjoined to cater
to the whims and vanities of exacting members by
visits that are not demanded by spiritual or temporal
needs, and which minister to nothing but the
aforesaid jealous vanity. Send for a clergyman
when his priestly offices are required. For the rest
of his precious time let him come as he likes, and
go whither he considers his duty calls him. He
was a man before he took orders, and the man has
social rights. Let him “neighbor,” as old-fashioned
folk used to say, with his kind.</p>

<p>The aforesaid “call” makes no mention of his
family. If you like to call on them when they come
to the parish, and if you find them congenial—your
congeners, in fact—keep up the association as you
would with your doctor’s, or your lawyer’s family.
That you belong to Doctor Barnabas’ parish, that
you are the wife or daughter of an officer in his
church, gives you absolutely no claim on his wife or
daughters beyond what you, individually, possess.
To demand that Mrs. Barnabas, refined in every
instinct, highly educated and with tastes for what
is best and highest in social companionship, should
be bullied and patronized by Mrs. Million, a purse-proud
vulgarian, unlearned and stupid, is sheer barbarity.
Yet we see it—and worse—in many American
churches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A FALSE ASSUMPTION</div>

<p>Do you, sensible and amenable reader, lead the
way to better things; loosen at least one buckle of
the harness that bows many a fine spirit to breaking,
and makes the church a smoke in the nostrils
of unprejudiced outsiders. Separate ecclesiastical
from social relations. Owe your right to call a
fellow parishioner “friend,” and to visit at manse
or parsonage, or rectory, to what you <i>are</i>—not to
the adventitious circumstance of being a member in
good standing in a fashionable, or an unfashionable,
church. Exact no consideration from those
who belong with you to the household of faith on
the ground of that spiritual “fellowship.” The position
is false; the claim ignoble.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No matter what church one is in, one should
always try to conform as far as possible to its order
of worship. Not to do this shows a want of proper
reverence.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV<br />

<small>THE WOMAN’S CLUB</small></h2>


<div class="sidenote">THE TOLERANT ATTITUDE</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE popularity of women’s societies for literary
study, for economic discussion, for the consideration
of municipal and social improvement, is
enormous. They are to be found all over the country,
but particularly do they flourish in the Middle
West, where every town and hamlet in the region
boasts a woman’s club of some sort. Both ridicule
and praise are showered upon these organizations;
and they deserve both. Some of their manifestations
are crude, absurd and tiresome; others are
fine in themselves, exert a broadening influence
over those intimately concerned, and are helpful indirectly
to the whole community represented by
them. However much particular societies may lay
themselves open to adverse criticism by reason of
priggishness, superficiality or a mistaken sense of
their importance in the scheme of things, it must
be acknowledged that the general tendency of these
organizations is good. They lift women out of the
consideration of the commonplace, domestic side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
existence; they encourage toleration and a give-and-take
attitude toward life, in which attitude women
are often lacking; they open a way for the development
of latent talent of various kinds; they are
often stepping stones to improvement in the social
life of a community. It would be hard to estimate
how much they have done in creating an atmosphere
for the truly artistic and literary element in
various communities throughout the United States.
No doubt they have in this way encouraged the production
of literature and other forms of art; while,
in humbler fashion, they have brought pleasure and
an outlook into many narrow circumscribed lives.</p>

<p>An English woman, visiting in a western city of
our country, was asked what one of our institutions
she admired the most. “The Woman’s Club,” she
replied without hesitation, and added that she would
like to transplant it to her native land where, it was
true, there were associations of women banded together
for various purposes, but none in which
women met in such easy and happy intellectual relations
as in the women’s clubs of America. Such
praise from an unprejudiced observer of our country
consoles the woman who believes in the mission
of the woman’s club despite many an ugly newspaper
fling. The English woman in question was
fortunate in attending a club of particular interest
and value where, to a degree, the ideal of what a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
woman’s club should be was realized. Such a club
indicates the possibilities of the institution, however;
and many organizations of women are working with
crude material through absurd phases toward accomplishment
as happy.</p>

<p>In small communities where the opportunities
are infrequent for theater, for social diversion of
various kinds, the woman’s club is of the greatest
help. It serves at once to focus and distribute all
the better social and intellectual interests of the
neighborhood. It may be a means of lifting a whole
community to a livelier and more interesting social
and intellectual level.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HELPING IN LEGISLATION</div>

<p>Many women’s clubs become important factors
in municipal legislation along the lines most amenable
to feminine influence. Through such clubs
women have helped to solve educational questions,
have influenced public sentiment in the direction of
cleaning and beautifying the streets, and in many
other ways have helped to promote law and order.
The literary club is, however, the form most often
taken by feminine organizations.</p>

<p>The formation of a literary club is not a difficult
matter, though the amount of red tape with which
it is sometimes covered up makes the project seem
formidable. The woman most interested in the organization
of such a club should call a meeting at
her house of those she thinks most likely to enter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
into the scheme with energy and profit. A perusal
of Robert’s <i>Rules of Order</i> or of any other good
manual of parliamentary law, will show how such a
meeting should be conducted, how officers should be
elected and a constitution adopted. It may be said
in this connection that there are few matters harder
for a woman to digest gracefully than a knowledge
of parliamentary usages. Such knowledge is for
use only, not for display. To make a show of it
is like using a kitchen utensil for a drawing-room
ornament. Many women seem to regard the rules
governing societies as important in themselves.
They are only important as the knowledge and
use of them quickens the business proceedings
leading up to the real purpose of the organization.
Business in a woman’s club, founded for study
and improvement, is only a means to an end. It is
disastrous to consider it otherwise.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MAKING OUT THE PROGRAM</div>

<p>The membership having been decided upon, the
officers selected and constitution adopted, the next
and most important thing in a literary club is to
make out the program. For this purpose an executive
committee of three or more is appointed
by the president or elected by the club. Sometimes
this committee makes out the entire program, merely
notifying each member of the part she is expected
to take in its performance. Sometimes the members
are consulted as to what subjects they prefer. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
more arbitrary method is often necessary in order to
procure unity of design in the program. If, for
instance, the program for the day includes two
papers and a discussion following, the subjects considered
should be related, so as to make some sort
of harmony. If each member is allowed to choose
her subject, regardless of anything but her own desire,
small pleasure or profit follows. In some clubs
the executive committee sends out cards to the members,
asking for suggestions, accepts the best of
these, and, when possible, assigns the topics preferred.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ASSIGNING THE TOPICS</div>

<p>If the first mentioned and more arbitrary method
is followed, the committee should be careful to select
subjects according to the persons for whom
they are designed. Mrs. Brown, who loves poetry,
but knows nothing of science, should not be asked
to handle the wonders of electricity in the twentieth
century; and Mrs. White, who has a delicious touch
in narrating personal experiences, but knows little
of continental fiction, would better be asked to write
a paper on her summer vacation than one on the
great Russian novelists, Turgenieff and Tolstoi. Of
course, the practise for Mrs. Brown and Mrs. White,
in considering subjects opposed to their knowledge
and taste, might be salutary for them, but it might
also send the other members of the club to sleep.
And the ambition of the executive committee should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
be to avoid as much dulness as possible in the atmosphere
it partly creates.</p>

<p>Whether the program shall be miscellaneous in
character, or shall be devoted to progressive study
in one direction, is a question to be considered by
the committee. If the club is small, compact in
spirit, and on improvement bent, the study of some
one period, author or movement is often most advantageous.
If the club is large, and entertainment
is largely the motive for meeting, a program that
varies to meet the various demands of the membership
is better.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CLUB SESSION</div>

<p>Usually, the number of papers on a given day
should not exceed two. Sometimes, owing to the
light or easily divisible nature of the theme for the
day, three papers, of fifteen or twenty minutes each,
may be assigned.</p>

<p>For the discussion that should follow the paper,
or papers, it is the custom generally in women’s
clubs to appoint a leader. The selection of leaders
for conversation should be carefully made. Not
every woman who writes a good paper talks well,
though it is possibly within her power to do so if
she makes sufficient effort. The leader of a conversation
should be one who has been tried in general
discussion and found successful. Upon the
leader depends the guidance of the talk. If it drifts
into foolish and unprofitable channels, it is her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
business to call it back to better issues, yet to do
so with what shall not seem a meddling or arbitrary
touch. The cultivation of the gift of speech is, in
the minds of many competent judges, the best thing
offered us by the woman’s club. Only a skilled person
should undertake leadership in a discussion, but
the floor of the club is a school where all may learn
something of the art. To learn to think quickly,
to express one’s self standing and facing an audience,—this
is an accomplishment worth having, and
one which many a club woman owes to years of progressive
effort in a woman’s club.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">ADMITTING NEW MEMBERS</div>

<p>Members should be taken into a club because they
have qualifications which will add to the pleasure
and profit of the membership at large. One should
not vote for or against a candidate for purely personal
reasons. Many kind people, who are yet ignorant
of the proper law for limiting the membership
of a club, consider it an act of enmity to
blackball a candidate for membership whether she
be fitted for that membership or not. This is a mistaken
and a sentimental theory. It is indeed disagreeable
to blackball, but it is sometimes necessary.
Those who propose members for a club should feel
the responsibility of such proposals and thus, as far
as lies within their power, avoid for the membership,
or committee controlling this matter, the unpleasant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
necessity of refusing or blackballing a
candidate.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ADDRESSING THE PRESIDENT</div>

<p>The new member should be received with courtesy
by the older members of the club. Her sponsors
or guarantors should see to it that proper introductions,
if introductions be necessary, are made.
For several months, at least, after her admission to
the club, the new member’s part should be a negative
rather than a positive one. It is an unwritten law
in the United States Senate that the new senator
does not speak on any matter of importance for a
year after his election. Exactly so, modesty demands
that the new member in a woman’s club, unless
specially requested, keep silent till custom has
established her place in the organization. When
the proper occasion arises for her to speak or to
read, she begins her performance as others do theirs,
by formally addressing the president and members
of the club thus: “Madam president and women
of the club.”</p>

<p>In many clubs, where the membership is not large
and the dues are small, it is customary to meet from
house to house. This should always be considered
only a provisional method. It is much better to
have a club home than to wander about from place
to place. Papers and other properties accumulate
in the life of a club, and it is advisable to have some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
permanent place for the bestowal of them. The
sense of getting acquainted with a new place each
time interferes with ease of manner and freedom
of discussion, while familiarity with one’s surroundings
begets both these happy qualities. As soon as
the funds warrant the expenditure, a club should
rent a convenient and acceptable place, where its
regular meetings can be held.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CLUB BREAKFAST</div>

<p>Once a year, usually at the beginning of the president’s
term of office, it is customary for the club
to give some sort of entertainment for its members.
This may be a luncheon or breakfast, a high tea or
merely an afternoon reception, where salad, ices and
coffee are served. At this festivity, after the menu
has been served, the retiring president bids good-by
to her office and introduces her successor, who acts
as toast-mistress for the occasion. The toasts
should be few in number, not more than five or six,
and the time occupied by each should be from five
to seven minutes. Commonly, the subjects for
toasts should be of a lively pleasing nature, and
should be treated in a manner to correspond. To
take advantage of a festive occasion for the delivery
of a lamentation or a sermon is in very bad taste.
It should be remembered by the speaker that she is
expected to entertain and not to instruct.</p>

<div class="sidenote">UNWISE CRITICISM</div>

<p>The spirit of the members toward club performances
should be kindly and genial, if good work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
is to be expected. Nothing can be done in the face
of ill-natured criticism. The standard of work can
only be raised by each member doing her best, and
keeping an open mind for the performances of her
acquaintances. Frequently a special advantage in
hearing club papers lies in one’s acquaintance with
the writer, which makes it possible for one to interpret
much more richly than would be possible in
the printed page of a personally unknown author.
This is the “unearned increment” of club membership,
one of the best returns for its fellowship; and,
in order to get the most out of one’s connection with
a literary club where, in the nature of things, one
can not be expecting literary masterpieces, one must
be on the lookout for this personal quality which
adds so largely to the written and spoken words
heard there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXXV<br />

<small>CHARITIES, PUBLIC AND PRIVATE</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">CHARITY begins at home, but it is a great mistake
to suppose that it should end there. Indeed,
in the last analysis, to do for one’s own family
is not charity, but a form of selfishness. The truly
generous spirit can not resist the call to help the
poor and needy, the outcast and degraded.</p>

<p>One’s relation to charity should not be accidental,
but should form a part of the plan of one’s life. It
is not very creditable to give to a good cause only
because one is besieged to do so, or because one is
ashamed to say “no.” When the young married
couple sit down together for their first discussion
of finance, of how much they shall spend for house,
for clothes, how much for food, how much for
amusement and so on, this question of what shall
be done for those poorer than themselves should
have a place. No matter how small the sum possible,
something should be given to philanthropic
work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>The woman of the family is very often, directly
or indirectly, the dispenser of the money devoted
to charity. She is the one who decides into what
channels it shall go. She has the time for investigating
the needs of societies and of individuals.
The work, too, that accompanies gifts of charity
more often falls to her lot than to a man. This is
a department of service properly belonging to her.
She has natural rights in this section of the world’s
work, of which she should be proud.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">TWO KINDS OF CHARITIES</div>

<p>Charities, broadly, are of two kinds, public and
private; and activity in one should not preclude
activity in the other. The ideal administration of
charity would consist in every person comfortably
established, having among his real friends several
poor persons or poor families from whom he himself
received a broadening knowledge of life, as well
as to whom he gave of physical necessities. In the
absence of this ideal situation, he must avail himself
of the best means open to him. He must take
advantage of the splendid organization of modern
charities, but he must not forget also to be on the
lookout for individual cases of need that are not
likely to appear before the board of any philanthropic
organization.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BUILDING UP CHARACTER</div>

<p>We hear it from the pulpit and the platform
continually, yet not too often, that organized charitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
work is one of the finest achievements of our
present civilization. Narrow-minded people sometimes
say that our grandmothers got along very well
without it, and did as much good as the women of
the present day. They got on without it only because
they did not have such complex conditions to
cope with. It is not possible, no matter how good
the intentions of the individuals concerned, that as
valuable work can be done without modern methods
as with them. In these days, each charity of a
city or town attempts to cover one field, and to cover
it as thoroughly and from as many different points
of view as possible. Wherever possible, the aim
of such organizations is to help people to help themselves.
The idea is not only to tide the beneficiaries
over temporary difficulties, but to aid them in building
up character by means of self-respecting effort.</p>

<p>Membership in such organizations brings opportunity
for action and knowledge also of the bearings
of one’s action. It makes charity something more
than a matter of sentimental impulse. The opportunity
to do good offered by these societies is not
only an opportunity to help the poor, but to help
one’s self, and even in other ways than the one generally
acknowledged of broadening one’s sympathies
and cultivating one’s heart. The gain a woman derives
in discipline from working in concert with
other women is of inestimable value. This discipline<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
is sometimes accompanied by vexations, as
discipline commonly is, but, taken in the right spirit,
it is broadening.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Charitable societies are often made up largely of
women whose ideas of business are chaotic, whose
capacity for speech is not at all equal to their capacity
for work. The time spent by such people
in idle discussion at business meetings is wearing,
but it is not altogether unprofitable. The better
trained women must do what they can to improve
the situation. When they can not improve it, they
must grin and bear it. Even with the drawbacks
named, organization pays. The experience of many
is a richer thing than the experience of one; and,
when it comes to action, concerted action is a more
powerful thing than single and individual effort.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SELECTION OF CHARITIES</div>

<p>One can not help all the causes one would like
to help, or belong to the organizations that represent
them. One should select that charity which appeals
to one most or where one feels one can do the most
good, and one should make attendance upon its
meetings and the other work of the society a part
of one’s regular duties. The sorrows of one’s life
often suggest the charity one cares most to aid.
Women who have lost little ones feel a drawing of
the heart toward the society that helps children.
Women who have seen much of pain and suffering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
in their own families wish to join a society that
makes the burden of the sick poor as light as possible.
Those who have seen sympathetically the
loneliness and bitterness possible to old age, wish
to help the aged poor. And the determining personal
experience makes the work of charity so much
richer and more effectual.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE SOCIAL SETTLEMENT</div>

<p>One should not leave the subject of one’s duty
to organized philanthropy without a word concerning
the work of the social settlement, the greatest
philanthropic movement of the day. The idea at
the bottom of settlement work, the idea that the rich
or the comfortably situated must live with the poor,
must know their lives by direct and continuous contact
in order to exert any lasting influence for good,
is a noble idea in itself and one that is singularly
attractive to ardent spirits.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, fashion and the novelty of the life
involved in the experiment has made social settlement
work attractive to many people for somewhat
selfish reasons. Such people should be discouraged
from going into it—first, because they hurt the
cause. They do not know how to get on with poor
people, and often their ill-disguised curiosity
amounts to insolence and hurts those whom it is
intended the work should benefit. The second reason
is that these people who, through excitement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
and love of novelty, leave their homes for settlement
work are often needed at home. It is much
the vogue just now for young women just out of
college to do a year of social settlement work. If
they have what Methodists name “the call,” and
have no more urgent and intimate duties behind
them, this is very well. But if it means deserting
home tasks because they are dull and unexciting, it
is well enough to think twice before the mother of
the family is left to face all the disagreeable issues
of home life. This is one of those cases where
charity at home is of more importance than charity
abroad. Of social settlement work, seriously and
earnestly considered, it is impossible to say too much
in commendation.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">PRIVATE GIVING</div>

<p>The philanthropic impulse of a generous heart
is not satisfied with giving to organizations or working
for them. One must do in other and private
ways in order to satisfy one’s heart and conscience.
One should help many people through ties of service,
of love or of friendship. In time of need, one
should remember those people who have lived as
domestics in one’s family, or who have been connected
in some humble capacity with the business of
the head of the house. These persons, if they have
been faithful to one’s interests, one helps with a
personal enthusiasm that is, of course, lacking in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
the case of strangers. Faithful or unfaithful, one
knows something about them, and can figure out
easily what is the wisest as well as the most grateful
manner of doing for them.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE POOR RELATION</div>

<p>Then there is the poor relation whom we have
always with us and, in the helping of whom, all
the tact of which one is possessed is not too much
to use. The very fact that he or she, as the case
may be, must accept favors from one of the same
blood and, therefore, in every sense but the financial,
of the same rank in life, makes the graceful bestowal
of the gift a matter that is hard to compass.
To pass on the gown one has laid aside so that there
shall seem to be no condescension in the act; to explain
successfully that one sends money at Christmas
because one was uncertain what would be the proper
gift to buy; in fine, to give with a broad sympathy
that, for the minute, gives the donor an insight into
the other’s disappointments and vexations—this is
what is needed in dealing with the poor relative.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">INDIVIDUAL HELP</div>

<p>A flavor of even greater grace and delicacy must
go into the gift offered by the rich friend to the
poor one. It is one of the privileges of the generous
rich, not only to feed the starving body but
sometimes to feed the starving soul, not only to
provide bread and butter but to minister to a starved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
sense of beauty and of joy. To give pictures and
books to those who love them but can not buy, to
give a year at college to some nice young fellow
whose parents can not do for him, to give pretty
trinkets to a pretty young girl who lives in a house
where there is no money to spare for such things—these
gifts of friendship are one of the greatest
privileges of a large income. Though not counted
commonly as charity, they come under the head of
charity in its biblical significance of love and sympathy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI<br />

<small>COURTESY FROM THE YOUNG TO THE OLD</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE pessimist, reading the heading of this
chapter, would be inclined to ask if one
writes nowadays of a lost quantity. While we do
not consider the grace of courtesy as entirely lost,
we are at times tempted to think that it has “gone
before,” and so far before that it is lost sight of
by the rising generation.</p>

<p>The days have passed when the hoary head was
a crown of glory, as the royal preacher declares.
It is certain that if it is a crown, it is one before
which the youth of the twentieth century do not
always bow.</p>

<p>Before we condemn the young unsparingly for
their lack of reverence, we must look at the other
side of the question. To-day there are few old
people. First, there is youth. That lasts almost
until one is a grandparent; then one is middle-aged.
No one is old,—at least few will acknowledge it.
The woman of forty-five is on “the shady side of
thirty,” she of sixty-five, is “on the down slope<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
from fifty.” And, even when the age is announced,
one is reminded that “a woman is only as old as
she feels.” There is sound common sense in all
this. Can not we afford to snap our fingers at
Father Time and his laws, when the law within
ourselves tells us that we are young in heart, in
feeling, in aims? So the principle that bids us shut
our eyes at the figure on the mile-stone we are
passing is a good one. As long as we feel fresh still
for the journey, as long as every step is a pleasure,
what difference if the walk has been five miles long
or fifteen? We judge of the strain by the effect it
has had on us. If we feel unwearied and ready
for miles and miles ahead of us, who shall say that
the walk has been ten miles long, when we are conscious
in our energetic limbs that it has only been
two delightful miles?</p>

<div class="sidenote">NO ONE IS OLD NOW</div>

<p>The fact that no one is now old has its effect on
the Young Person in our midst. She hesitates to
say to the matron, “Take this seat, please!” when
she knows that in her soul the matron will resent
the insinuation that she is on the downward grade.
Not long ago I witnessed the chagrin of a woman of
thirty-five who rose and gave her seat in a stage to
a woman who was, if one may judge by the false
standard of appearances, at least fifteen years her
senior. The elderly woman flushed indignantly:</p>

<p>“Pray keep your seat, madam!” she commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
in stentorian tones. “I may be gray-headed, but I
am <i>not</i> old or decrepit!”</p>

<p>I fancy that one reason gray hair is becoming
fashionable is this desire to cling to youth. Every
year more young women tell us that they are prematurely
gray, and their sister-women add eagerly,
“So many women are, nowadays!”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE IMPORTANCE OF TACT</div>

<p>Our Young Person must, then, be very careful
how she displays the feeling of reverence for age
which, we would like to believe, is inherent in every
well-regulated nature. She must exercise tact,
without which no person will have popularity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">APPRECIATING ONE’S ELDERS</div>

<p>One point in which Young America displays
lamentable vulgarity is in the habit of interrupting
older people. Interruptions, we of a former generation
were taught, are rude. That is a forgotten fact
in many so-called polite circles. And when people
do not interrupt they seem to be waiting for the
person speaking to finish what he has to say in
order to “cut in” (no other expression describes it
fitly) with some new and original remark. That
is, apparently, the only reason that one listens to
others,—just for the sake of having some one to
answer. The world is full of things, and getting
fuller every day, and unless one talks most of the
time he will never be able to air his opinions on
all points. And every one’s opinion is of priceless
value,—at least to himself. This seems to be the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
attitude of Young America. Yet in courtesy to the
hoary head one should occasionally pause long
enough to allow the owner thereof to express an
opinion. Although one has passed fifty, one may,
nevertheless, have sound judgment and ideas on
some subjects that are worth consideration. I wish
young men and women would occasionally remember
this.</p>

<p>The woman of sixty, or over, can really learn
little of value from her granddaughter,—even when
that granddaughter is a college graduate, and has
all the arrogance of twenty years. Of course,
grandmother may need enlightenment on college
athletics, on golf, even, perhaps, on bridge,—although
that is very doubtful, if she lives in a fashionable
neighborhood. But, after all, these are not
the greatest things of life. She would, perchance,
be glad to listen to her young relative’s accounts of
her sports if she would take the trouble to tell the
happenings that interest her in a loving respectful
spirit. Our elderly woman does not like to be
patronized, to be told that she dresses like an old
fashion-plate, and that she is, to use the slang of
the day, a “back number.” The grandmother knows
better. She has lived and she is sure that from her
store of knowledge of life—of men, women and
things as they really are—she could bring forth
treasures, new and old, that would be of great help<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
to the hot-headed, impulsive young girl about to
risk all on the perilous journey that lies before her.</p>

<p>I would, therefore, suggest that Our Girl practise
deference toward her elders. At first she may not
find it easy, but it is worth cultivating. It is, moreover,
much more becoming than arrogance and
aggressiveness, too common nowadays. There is
something wrong when a person feels no respect for
one who has attained to double or treble her years.
There is something lacking. The collegians of both
sexes would do well to turn their analytical minds
on themselves, and, as improvement is the order of
the day, add to their fund of becoming attainments
the sweet old-fashioned attribute of courtesy and
reverence toward age.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SMALL COURTESIES</div>

<p>It is easy, after all, if one will watch carefully,
to do the little kind thing that makes for comfort,
and not do it aggressively. It is not necessary to
adjust a pillow at the elderly person’s back as if
she needed it. I saw a sweet woman put a pillow
behind an invalid with such tact that the sufferer,
who was acutely sensitive on the subject of her
condition, did not suspect that her hostess had her
illness in mind.</p>

<p>“My dear,” said this tactful woman, “if you are
‘built’ as I am, you must find that chair desperately
uncomfortable without a cushion behind you! <i>I</i>
simply <i>will not</i> sit in it without this little bit of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
pillow wedged in at the small of my back. I find
it so much more comfortable <i>so</i>, that I am sure you
will.”</p>

<p>And the cushion was adjusted. Could even supersensitive
and suspicious Old Age have resented such
attention?</p>

<p>Of course elderly people like to talk. Why should
they not be allowed to do it? The boy or girl
listener is impatient of what he or she terms inwardly
“garrulousness.” Is not the prattle of
youth as trying to old people? But, to do them
justice, unless they are very crabbed, they listen to
it kindly.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, one seldom sees a young person
rise and remain standing when an old person enters
the room. Yet to loll back in a chair under such
circumstances is one of the greatest rudenesses of
which a girl or boy is capable.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE OLD MAN</div>

<div class="sidenote">GENEROSITY TO AGE</div>

<p>Right here, may I put in a plea for the old man?
In the first place, he is not so popular as the old
woman. <i>She</i> is often beloved; he, poor soul! is
too often endured. In very truth he is not so lovable
as his lady-wife. He did not take the time
while he was young to cultivate the little niceties of
life as she did. Women have more regard for appearances
than men have, and their life is not spent
so often in counting-room and office; they are, in
their daily life, surrounded by refined persons more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
than are their husbands; they do not have to talk
by the hour with rough men, give orders to surly
underlings, eat at lunch counters, and join in the
morning and evening rush-for-life to get a seat in
the crowded car or train where the law is “<i>Sauve
qui peut!</i>” or, in brutal English “Every man for
himself”—no matter who—“for the hindmost!”
All these things, after years and years, influence the
man or woman. It is inevitable. It even affects the
inner life. The Book of books tells us that though
the outward man perish, the inward man is renewed
day by day. Sometimes the inward man is hardly
worth renewing at the end of a life of such rush
and mad haste after the elusive dollar that there has
been no place for the gentle amenities of existence.
Therefore, as the man gets old, his nature comes
to the front, and, too often, the courtesies that were
pinned on him by a loving wife, and kept polished
up by her, drop off and he does not want to bother
to have them readjusted. Consequently, he often
has habits that are not pretty. He is irascible; he
is intolerant with youth, and, now that he is laid
aside, he likes to tell of what he did when he was
as active as the young men about him. Dear young
people, let him talk! Listen to him, and remember
that at your age he was just as agreeable as you.
Consider, too, that if, when you are old, you would
escape being the self-absorbed being you think him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
you would do well now to begin to avoid the selfishness
and self-absorption that you find make the old
man objectionable. Practise on him, and he will in
his old age still be doing a good work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A WORD TO THE WISE</div>

<p>It is not pleasant to feel old, to know that you
are set aside in the minds of others as “a has-been.”
There are few more cruel lessons given to human
beings to learn in this hard school we call life. And
this task has to be learned when strength and courage
wane, and the grasshopper is a burden. If
young people would only make it unnecessary for
the older person to acquire it! It lies with youth
to make the declining years of those near the end
of the journey a weary waiting for that end, or a
peaceful loitering on a road that shall be a foretaste
of a Land in which no one ever grows old.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII<br />

<small>MISTRESS AND MAID</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THEY were not foreordained from all eternity
to be sworn enemies. Could that fact be
impressed on the mind of each, there would be less
friction between them.</p>

<p>Where, in this day and in this country, is found
the family servant who follows the fortunes of her
employers through adversity and evil report, asking
only to be allowed to live among those who have
shown her kindness, who have taught her all she
knows, and who have been kinder to her than her
own family have been? She may exist in the imagination
of the optimistic novelist,—but not in reality.
Once in a great while such a servant, well-advanced
in life, is found,—but she is a rara avis.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it should be remembered that
the burden of blame and of responsibility for improvement
rest with the woman of larger opportunity.
If we heard considerably more of “the mistress
problem,” we should probably hear less of the
servant one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">BOTH MUST HELP</div>

<p>It is trite to say that in this country the servant
matter is all askew. We know that, and it is incumbent
on us to make the best of matters as we
find them. To do this both mistress and maid
should be impressed with the fact expressed in the
opening sentence of this chapter. As matters now
are, the maid sees in the mistress a possible tyrant,
one who will exact the pound of flesh, and, if the
owner thereof be not on her guard, will insist on
a few extra ounces thrown in for good measure.
The mistress sees in the suspicious girl a person who
will, if the chance be offered her, turn against her
employer, will do the smallest amount of work
possible for the highest wages she can demand;
break china, smash glass, shut her eyes to dirt in
the corners, and accept the first opportunity that
offers itself to leave her present place and get one
that demands fewer duties and larger pay.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One of the great mistakes of the mistress is that
she lets the state of affairs greatly disturb her. Why
should she? The maid is not “her own kind,” and
the woman is wrong who judges the uneducated,
ill-reared hireling by the rules that govern the better-educated
classes. The servant and the employer
have been reared in different worlds, and to ignore
this fact is folly. How often do we see the mistress
“hurt” because of Norah’s lack of consideration for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
her and her time, and vexed because the servant
fails to appreciate any kindness shown her? Let
her accept the condition of affairs as what the slangy
boy would call “part of the game,” and not waste
God-given nerve and energy in worrying over it. If
she gets reasonably good return in work for the
wages she pays, she should be content.</p>

<p>If a woman’s maid does something wrong or
omits a duty, however important, if guests are
present the mistake should be remedied as quietly
as possible and without reproof. To rebuke a
servant before others is a great unkindness to her
and needlessly embarrasses the visitor.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">EXPECT THE BEST</div>

<div class="sidenote">ALWAYS BE CONSIDERATE</div>

<p>The mistress should not expect a friend and counselor
in the maid. Once in a while, one meets a
servant who, by some accident, is capable of discerning
the refinement of nature in her employer,
and of respecting it. In this case, she will care more
for the employer for knowing that she is trusted.
It is a fact that, by appealing to the best in human
nature—be that nature American, Irish, German
or Scandinavian—we elicit the best from our fellow
creatures. Let the mistress, then, try to believe in
the good intentions of her servant, or, if she can
not really believe in them, let her attempt to do so.
Her attitude of mind will, unconsciously to herself,
make itself felt upon her helper. Let her take it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
for granted that the “new girl” means to stay, is
honest, trustworthy and anxious to please, and let
her talk to her as if all these things were foregone
conclusions. She may show by gentle manner and
kindly consideration that Norah or Gretchen is a
sister-woman, not a machine. If a washing or
ironing happens to be heavy, let her suggest a simple
dessert of fruit, instead of the pudding that had
been planned. And if the maid’s heavy eyes and
forced smile show that she is not well, let the
mistress, for a brief moment, put herself in the
place of the hireling, and think what she would
want done for her under similar circumstances. She
will then suggest that some of the work that can
be deferred be laid aside until the following day,
or offer to give a hand in making the beds or dusting
the rooms.</p>

<p>“But,” declares the systematic housewife, “I do
not hire a servant,—and then do my housework!”</p>

<p>No! Neither did you hire your maid-of-all-work
to be a sick nurse,—but were you ill it would be
she who would cook your meals, carry up your
tray and take care of you, unless you were so ill as
to need the services of a trained attendant. Bear
this in mind, and show the maid that you do bear
it in mind.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">WORK AFTER HOURS</div>

<p>It is a more difficult matter to get the servant to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
look at the subject from this standpoint. She has
not been educated to regard things from both sides.
It is the custom of her cult to meet and, in conclave
assembled, to compare the faults, foibles and failings
of their employers. And when they do commend
an employer for kind treatment it is, as a
rule, only to make the lot of another servant look
darker by contrast with the bright one depicted.</p>

<p>“Oh, me dear!” exclaims Bridget on entering
Norah’s kitchen at eight-thirty in the evening and
finding her still washing dishes. “And is this the
hour that a poor hard-working girl is kept up to
wash the dinner-things? There are no such doin’s
in <i>my</i> kitchen, I tell ye! My lady knows that I ain’t
made of iron, and she knows, too, that I would not
put up with such an imposition!”</p>

<p>The fact that Norah’s mistress has helped her all
day with the work, that she is herself the victim of
unexpected company, that she regrets as much as
Norah can that the unavoidable detention at the
office of the master of the house has made dinner
later than usual, does not deter the suddenly-enlightened
girl from feeling herself a martyr, and the
seed of hate and distrust is quick to bear fruit in
an offensive manner and a sulky style of speech.</p>

<p>She does not pause to take into consideration that,
while she may just now be doing extra work, she
also receives daily extra kindnesses and consideration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
that were not agreed upon in the contract of
her hire.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">TWO WAYS OF DOING</div>

<p>There are just two rules that make the relations
of mistress and maid tolerable or pleasant. One is
that everything be put on a purely business basis—an
arrangement hardly practical in domestic
labor. The other rule, and the better, is that a little
practical Christianity be brought into the relationship,—that
the maid do her best, cheerfully and
willingly, and that the mistress treat her in the same
spirit, giving her little pleasures when it is within
her power to do so, trying to smooth the rough
places, and to make crooked things straight. Then,
let each respect the other and make the best of the
situation. If it is intolerable, it may be changed.
If not intolerable, let each remember that there
is no law, human or divine, that demands that
the contract stand forever—and let each dissolve
the partnership when she wishes to do so. Until
this is done, mistress and maid should keep silence
as to the faults of the other, trying to see rather
the virtues than the failings of a sister-woman.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I wish that some word of mine with regard to this
matter could sink into the mind of the mistress. I
fear that it will never be possible to train the maid
not to talk of her mistress to her friends. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
employer should be above discussing her servants
with outsiders. This is one of the most glaring
faults of conversation,—one of the most flagrant
breaches of conversational etiquette among women
of refinement. The hackneyed warning that the
three <i>D’s</i> to be banished from polite conversation
are Dress, Disease and Domestics, has not been
heeded by the average housewife, so far as the last
<i>D</i> is concerned. She will fill willing and unwilling
ears with the account of her servants’ impertinences,
of their faults, of how they are leaving without
giving warning, and of how ungrateful all servants
are, until one would think that her own soul was
not above that of the laundress, chambermaid and
cook, whose failings she dissects in public. Such
talk reminds one of the conversation with which
Bridget regales an admiring and indignant coterie.
With the uneducated hireling, it may be pardonable;
in the case of the educated employer it is inexcusable.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The best-trained servants say “Yes, madam,” instead
of “Yes, ma’am.” In England women as well
as men servants are addressed by their surnames.
The custom does not commend itself to our American
ideas.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">WOMEN WITH ONE MAID</div>

<div class="sidenote">CAPS AND APRON</div>

<p>Women who keep only one maid should, if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
possible, have the laundry work done out of the
house. Only so can one be sure of a trim-looking
servant to answer the door. And the appearance of
the person who admits us to a house is taken, very
justly, as a criterion of the domestic standards of
the house. A popular novelist once divided the
houses in a certain city into three classes: those
that had maids, those that had maids without caps,
and those who had maids with caps. A woman’s
social standing need not depend on her having a
maid at all,—she may “quite come to her own
door,” as one snobbish woman puts it, but if she keep
a maid, the maid should be properly dressed, and
the cap is as essential a part of her dress as her
apron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII<br />

<small>THE WOMAN WITHOUT A MAID</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE thought of being without a maid strikes
dismay to the heart of many a woman who
can not be accused of laziness. She thinks of the
manual toil connected with housekeeping as composed
of a round of degrading tasks, and she can
not imagine herself as performing these with dignity
and attractiveness. The ugliness connected with
doing Bridget’s work is what repels, and it must
be confessed, at the start, that dust and dish-water
are not agreeable things to contemplate, though
hemmed squares of clean cheese-cloth for the one
and plenty of good soap in the other tend to reduce
disagreeable qualities to a minimum. One half, at
least, of the prejudice many women, not financially
prosperous, feel against “doing their own work,”
as the phrase curiously goes, is the aversion to doing
unbeautiful things. The other half rises from the
sense of dismay in attempting that in which one
has had no practise, for which one has had no previous
preparation. The tasks connected with housekeeping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
are many and various; and if one is called
to face them without experience or a system, the
result is apt to be pandemonium until the mistress-maid
is broken in. It is a pity, however, to approach
the work with the idea that it is necessarily distasteful
and disagreeable. Most women have some
natural aptitude for domestic service. When properly
trained they like it, or, at least, parts of it. What
they lack often is not aptitude but practise; and,
instead of expecting to gain skill through practise,
as they would in other departments of work, they
expect it to come by inspiration. Housekeeping is
a science and an art. More even than this, it is a
business, and needs, exactly as the business of a
man does, time and patience for its conquest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">DRESSING FOR WORK</div>

<p>A sub-professor on a small salary in one of our
best eastern educational institutions married a
charming young woman with a wise head on her
pretty shoulders. Her thought was that she could
best help him by doing the work of a maid. Her
name wherever known had been a synonym for exquisite
taste, and she lost nothing of this in the conduct
of her new rôle. Ugliness of any sort was not
in her scheme of things. She determined that she
should be no less pretty in her husband’s eyes because
of the part she was to play in his kitchen. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
had made for herself eight blue and white striped
seersucker gowns with broad hems on the short
skirts and with plain shirt-waists. The sleeves were
made elbow length, so as not to incommode her in
her work, and a turnover collar of white which left
her throat free was at once comfortable and becoming.
With these dresses she wore dark aprons or
white ones, according to the work she was doing.
Her husband and friends declared she had never
looked more pleasing than while “in service.” She
was an excellent refutation of the idea that a woman
must look slovenly when doing household tasks.
Though “dressing the part” seems a small beginning
toward getting the work of a house done, it is a
helpful beginning because it affects the spirits. A
working woman needs working clothes. If they be
pretty as well as comfortable and appropriate, they
give an impetus toward cheerful labor that is not
to be lightly estimated.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">AVOID INTERRUPTIONS</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE VALUE OF SYSTEM</div>

<p>A woman who learns to be her own maid and
makes a success of the work must adopt it as a
business and must devote herself to her tasks with
regularity and system. She must be firm against
intrusion and interruption from the outside world.
She must adopt housekeeping as a profession and
aim not merely at completing the daily round but
at achieving an excellence that will in time impart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
interest to the work. Order and simplicity are the
two laws she must obey if she is to get through with
dignity and self-respect. An order of the day and
an order of the week must be made out and followed
as far as possible. System and arrangement are
the great time savers. To sit down at one’s desk
once a day or once a week and make out conscientiously
a list of all the things necessary to be done
in the time named, then divide and tabulate these
according as seems best,—this use of the brain will
economize time and will save many a weary step.</p>

<p>Orderliness in work leads most directly to that
harmony and peace in housekeeping which the average
woman is so fearful of losing when she takes
up the labor for herself. The writer used frequently
to take luncheon at the house of a clever friend
who cooked and served the meals. Her cooking
could always be counted on as delicious; but it was
the serving, that Scylla and Charybdis in one, of
most women who must “do” entirely for themselves,
that astonished and delighted one. On a
side-table, ready for her hand, were placed the extra
dishes needed. On this, too, was room for those
things only temporarily necessary on the dining-table.
The occasions when the hostess must rise
to serve her guests were reduced by the perfection
of her arrangements to a minimum. When she
was compelled to visit pantry or kitchen, she left the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
table without a flurry and was back with the article
in question almost before one realized her departure.
This grace in service was partly, of course, a matter
of nature, but it was largely due to trained and systematic
habits of work. These oiled the wheels of
housekeeping and made them run more or less
smoothly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">A SIMPLE MENU</div>

<p>The woman without a maid must cultivate simplicity
as well as order in her household arrangements.
To do this requires some originality of soul
and mind. She must model her work not upon
what her neighbors and friends do, but upon what
she thinks necessary to be done for the comfort and
good health of herself and those dependent upon
her. She must not attempt more things than she
can do well. Many a young woman who starts out
with joyous intention to be cook for husband and
family, fails in her intention by reason of planning
too large a bill of fare. For beginners, at least, it
is well to cut out made desserts and pretentious
salads. A cream soup with a broiled steak, potatoes
nicely cooked, lettuce with a French dressing, coffee
and fruit, make a dinner which, if neatly served,
affords nourishment and delight to the ordinary
man. How much better to attempt nothing more
than this and make a success of it than to try for
roast, two or three vegetables, an intricate salad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
and a pudding,—to have these imperfectly achieved
and awkwardly served. For it goes without saying
that it is much more difficult to serve an elaborate
than a simple meal. Also the elaborate meal demands
for serving many more dishes, and the extra
dishes make added work in the dish-washing which
follows a meal as the night the day. Simplicity of
living must be the aim of the woman who does her
own work. It is only by cultivating simplicity that
she can live restfully and with the taste that makes
for beauty.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">DIVIDING HOUSEHOLD TASKS</div>

<p>In a household where no servant is employed
each member of the family should regularly perform
certain duties. Where there is a family of
some size all the work should not be crowded upon
the shoulders of the mistress. If one person does
the dusting, another the mending, another the cooking,
another the sweeping, and so on through the
list of necessary employment in a household, the
burden need not fall too heavily upon any one. No
paid servant can feel the interest in successful
achievement that rewards the effort of those who
are laboring for the convenience and beauty of their
own home. A household conducted on plans of the
most rigid economy may still be cheerful and even
charming if the members of it choose to view the
matter in a sort of Bohemian, picnicking spirit. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
the duties are assigned with regard to the tastes and
capacities of each, no real hardship is involved and
a spirit of gaiety is invoked by the concerted effort
at producing comfort with the expenditure of little
money.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE VULGARITY OF PRETENSE</div>

<p>An utter absence of pretense is the only graceful
attitude in a home conducted in the way described.
To be ashamed of the work one does and to try to
conceal it results in an uneasy, hypocritical manner
and deceives no one. “I almost opened my own
door when she called on me,” said a silly, snobbish,
impecunious woman in telling of the visit paid her
by a rich resident of the neighborhood. The remark
blinded no one and made the speaker ridiculous.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There are books of various kinds written for the
help of the woman who must get on without a maid.
These often can make for her a quicker and better
path to her goal than she can work out alone and
unaided. One of the best-known stories about the
great English statesman, Charles James Fox, is of
his learning to carve. He determined to make a
conquest of this branch of knowledge as he did of
any other attempted by him. Day after day he
brought to the dining-table with him a book on
carving, and cut the fowl or joint placed before him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
in accordance with the rules of the book. His subsequent
beautiful carving was the result of this
method, of his willingness to learn the best way of
doing whatever he attempted.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">HELP FROM COOK-BOOKS</div>

<p>Reliable books on cooking, on the relative values
of foods, on sanitary housekeeping, are not hard
to find, while the magazines and papers are full of
happy suggestions on these and kindred themes. A
woman who intends to be her own maid should
possess some reliable volumes on her subject, should
make her work more interesting to herself and more
valuable to her family by a reference to authorities
on her subject. The more one knows about the
work one has in hand, the more one is apt to care
for it. And enthusiasm for one’s task, in its turn,
begets good work.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No woman on whom falls the burden of keeping
her own house should feel permanently discouraged.
She may learn to do her task not only with comfort
but with grace. The difficulties in her way can be
surmounted through experience and study. If she
has a natural liking for the ordering and managing
of a house, her work may become a delight. “Why
do you look so sad?” said one woman to another.
“Because I have a perfect maid,” said the second.
“All my life until recently I kept house for my husband<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
and myself. Housekeeping was my passion as
music is yours. Now my husband insists that I shall
keep a maid. She knows her business. It would spoil
her if I helped. I am a stranger in my own kitchen.
Wouldn’t you be unhappy if you had no opportunity
to play Chopin and Beethoven? Well, I am miserable
because I can’t concoct salads and soups.” This
testimony to the joys of housekeeping is extreme,
but it may serve to cheer some beginner in domestic
labor who sees only duty but no pleasure in the
work.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">A SOUTHERN GIRL’S PARTY</div>

<p>To feel that because one is limited in means one
can not entertain is wholly mistaken. The young
lady in a southern family in aristocraite Charleston,
herself the granddaughter of a governor of the state
and a member of the famous St. Cecilia Society,
told the writer, who was a “paying guest” in the
simple home, how she entertained her friends. “In
the morning we whip up a cake, order cream, telephone
the girls, and when they come, that’s the
party!” But her own delightful spirit of hospitality,
the perfection of her breeding, were the
largest element in that party’s undoubted success.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX<br />

<small>WOMAN IN BUSINESS RELATIONS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE number of women who enter into business
life and the number of avenues open to them
for earning a living are constantly increasing. And
however much we may be disposed to ridicule the
agitation concerning woman’s progress and the
rights of woman, no fair-minded person can fail
to recognize the happy changes such agitation in
the last decade has wrought in the attitude of the
world toward women who make their own way in
it. The old-fashioned prejudice of gentility against
a woman employing her powers to make money has
very largely disappeared. Many a delicate-minded
woman of the old school has lived in poverty or
has incurred unwillingly financial obligations to
family connections because of the prejudice against
her doing something for herself, because of the feeling
that her social position, a matter naturally of
high importance to a woman, would be injured by
her stepping out of the family niche and picking up
something for herself on the highway open to all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
She feared more even than this, perhaps, the loss
of those particularly feminine attributes and charms
so dear to every real woman’s heart. In the old-fashioned
conception of a woman who worked outside
of her own home, it used to be taken for
granted that she must be denied social consideration
and must give up her share of fun in the world.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A LIBRARY ATTENDANT</div>

<p>All this is now a matter of history, and is recalled
only for the purpose of showing the contrast
between her former outlook and her present one.
Except in a few ultra fashionable communities in
the United States, the social position of a woman
in business is not affected unhappily by her work.
Provided she has the qualities requisite for social
recognition and consideration, her business is no
detriment. She has the same general opportunities
for social recreation that offer themselves to a man
of business, and it often happens that her work gives
a zest to the enjoyment of such opportunities, unknown
to women of idler habits. The writer has
in mind, as an example, an engaging young woman
who serves most acceptably as attendant in the public
library of a western city. Her duties keep her
from nine in the morning till six in the evening,
but they have not, in the least, obscured her charmingly
agreeable personal quality. She is much in
demand. The number of her masculine admirers
is large enough to excite the envy of many a girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
whose father’s bank-account is a large one. The
attention she gives to her work seems to impart an
added vivacity to her playtime.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">BUSINESS IS BUSINESS</div>

<p>Notwithstanding the fact, however, that a woman
may enjoy the leisure she has for social demands
as much after entering business life as before, she
must not carry the little graces and amenities of
society into business life. Business is business with
a woman as well as a man, and the woman who succeeds
in the calling she has chosen is the one who
does not attempt to mix its details with matters of
a more recreative nature. She must not expect to
win favors by any but the straightforward method
of doing her work well. The prejudice which so
long existed among men against women in business
relations was partly caused by the thought that they
could never forget that they were women, could
never discuss work or business relations on impersonal
and rational grounds. The first lesson a
woman must learn in making her own way financially
is to appreciate the fact that the office, the
shop, whatever be her place of employment, is no
place for superfluous courtesies. The cultivation
of a cool, matter-of-fact, unsentimental way of
looking at the work in hand, is the only path to honorable
achievement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">GOOD DRESSING IMPORTANT</div>

<p>What a woman wears, cheap moralists to the
contrary, is always important. It is especially important
in business relations because the impression
she creates is, to a considerable degree, dependent
upon it. The self-supporting woman, when about
her work, should not dress elaborately or conspicuously.
Bright colors, jewels, extreme hats
should be rigidly barred from her wardrobe. She
should be dressed quietly but becomingly, with exquisite
neatness and, to a reasonable extent, in the
prevailing mode. A quiet elegance in style, care in
the manner of putting on her clothes,—these go a
long way toward creating the proper appearance for
the woman in business. Human nature being as it
is, the properly gowned woman of business has a
far better chance than the one who is dowdily
dressed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The habit of many young girls in the business
world of wearing sleeves that do not come to the
elbow and displaying an amount of chest that would
be proper only at an evening party, is a serious mistake.
Another mistake is the marked preference for
wearing, even in winter time, white shirt-waists. If
these waists are to be really fresh and fit for wear,
a new one must be put on every day, and that is an
expense that the wearers clearly can not afford.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
Dark dresses, with touches of white at neck and
wrists, are a much wiser choice when one must
economize.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">OPPORTUNITIES IN BUSINESS</div>

<p>It is very commonly said that men have larger
interests than women, and that one reason for this
lies in the fact that, in their every-day work, they
form, naturally and easily, relations with many people;
whereas a woman’s relations with the world too
often come through the more artificial channels of
pleasure. A woman in business has the same opportunity
for meeting people on real ground that
a man has. She should take advantage of these
openings to healthful communication with her kind.
We have all come in contact with women who have
been thus broadened and have realized in them a
kind of attraction not to be found in women leading
more secluded lives. It is well in summing up
the pros and cons of the business woman’s life to
lay stress on her advantages, and the one just named
is one of which she should make the most.</p>

<p>Women, as a class, are sometimes accused of a
lack of method in the performance of their tasks.
This is owing to the fact that the duties of domestic
life may often be performed at any hour the housekeeper
chooses, and that attention to them is not
rigidly fixed as to time. A business career is often
an effectual remedy for desultory habits. And this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>
is the reason that many women who have served
a time as wage-earners come back to housekeeping
with renewed energy and ability. The best housekeepers
the writer has ever known were retired
women of business. They put into the tasks of the
home the method, the promptness they learned in a
more exacting field.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">AFTER WORKING HOURS</div>

<p>However, women who are engaged the greater
part of the day in offices, libraries, in shops, should
not be expected to engage to any large degree in
household duties. It sometimes happens that the
members of a family circle, in which one woman
goes out to earn her bread and butter, have little
consideration for her tired state of mind and body
when she leaves her work and returns to her home.
They expect of her a double duty, and this is manifestly
unfair. It is most important that a business
woman have rest or diversion in her spare time, so
that she will not get into a rut, so that she may do
justice to her work.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A WORD OF ADVICE</div>

<p>Her family should not forget that her money-making
powers will be crippled by forced attention
to other duties. Men are treated far more considerately
in this regard than women. Nothing is
allowed to interfere with the average business man’s
arrangements. To facilitate these, everything possible
is done by his family. This may be because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>
men are more insistent, because they have a way
of demanding their rights. It would be well for
women in business, well also for their families, that
they should “look sharp” and pursue the same
policy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL<br />

<small>A FINANCIAL STUDY FOR OUR YOUNG MARRIED
COUPLE</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THIRTY years ago I held a heart-to-heart talk
with reasonable, well-meaning husbands on the
vital subject of the monetary relations between man
and wife.</p>

<p>I quote a paragraph, the force of which has been
confirmed to my mind by the additional experience
and observation of three more decades than were
set to my credit upon the age-roll when I penned
the words:</p>

<p>“I have studied this matter long and seriously,
and I offer you, as the result of my observation in
various walks of life, and careful calculation of
labor and expense, the bold assertion that every
wife who performs her part, even tolerably well,
in whatsoever rank of society, more than earns her
living, and that this should be an acknowledged fact
with both parties to the marriage contract. The
idea of her dependence upon her husband is essentially
false and mischievous, and should be done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
away with, at once and forever. It has crushed self-respect
out of thousands of women; it has scourged
thousands from the marriage-altar to the tomb, with
a whip of scorpions; it has driven many to desperation
and crime.”</p>

<p>I have headed this chapter “A Financial Study
for Our Young Married Couple,” because I have
little hope of changing the opinions and custom of
the mature benedict. Our youthful wedded pair
should come to a rational mutual understanding in
the first week of housekeeping as to an equitable
division of the income on which they are to live
together.</p>

<p>If you—our generic “John”—shrink from coming
down to “cold business” before the echoes of
the wedding-bells have died in ear and in heart, call
the discussion a “matter of marriage etiquette,” and
approach it confidently. And do you, Mrs. John,
meet his overtures in a straightforward, sensible
way, with no foolish shrinking from the idea of
even apparent independence of him to whom you
have entrusted your person and your happiness?</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE WIFE’S PORTION</div>

<p>It is, of course, your part to harken quietly to
whatever proposition your more businesslike spouse
may make as to the just partition, not of his means,
which are likewise yours, but of the sums you are
respectively to handle and to spend. Do not accept
what he apportions for your use as a benefaction.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
He has endowed you with all his worldly goods, and
the law confirms the endowment to a certain extent.
You are a co-proprietor—not a pensioner. If,
while the glamour of Love’s Young Dream envelops
and dazes you, you are chilled by what seems sordid
and commonplace, take the word of an old campaigner
for it that the time will come when your
“allowance” will be a factor in happiness as well
as in comfort.</p>

<p>May I quote to John another and a longer extract
from the thirty-year-old “Talk concerning Allowances”?</p>

<div class="sidenote">LEARN TO SAY WE</div>

<p>“Set aside from your income what you adjudge
to be a reasonable and liberal sum for the maintenance
of your household in the style suitable for
people of your means and position. Determine
what purchases you will yourself make, and what
shall be entrusted to your wife, and put the money
needed for her proportion into her care as frankly
as you take charge of your share. Try the experiment
of talking to her as if she were a business
partner. Let her understand what you can afford
to do, and what you can not. If in this explanation
you can say ‘we’ and ‘ours,’ you will gain a decided
moral advantage, although it may be at the cost of
masculine prejudice and pride of power. Impress
upon her mind that a certain sum, made over to her
apart from the rest, is hers absolutely, not a present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>
from you, but her honest earnings, and that <i>you</i>
would not be honest were you to withhold it. And
do not ask her ‘if that will do?’ any more than you
would address the question to any other woman.
With what cordial detestation wives regard that
brief query which drops, like a sentence of the Creed,
from husbandly lips, I leave your spouse to tell you.
Also, if she ever heard of a woman who answered
anything but ‘Yes!’”</p>

<p>Carrying out the idea of co-partnership, should
your wife exceed her allowance, running herself,
and consequently you, into debt, meet the exigency
as you would a similar indiscretion on the part of
a young and inexperienced member of your firm.
Treat the extravagance as a mistake, not a fault.
Not one girl-wife in one hundred, who has not been
a wage-earner, has had any experience in the management
of finances. The father gives the daughter
money when she (or her mother) tells him that she
needs it, or would like to have it. When it is gone
he is applied to for more. She has been a beneficiary
all her life, usually an irresponsible, thoughtless
recipient of what is lavished or doled out to her,
according to the parental whim and means.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LEARNING BUSINESS METHODS</div>

<p>Teach her business methods, tactfully, yet decidedly.</p>

<p>One young wife I wot of began keeping the expense-book,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span>
presented to her by her husband, with
these entries:</p>

<p>“<i>January fourth.</i> Received $75.00 (Seventy-five
dollars).</p>

<p>“<i>January sixth.</i> Spent $70.25 shopping, etc.</p>

<p>“Balance—$4.75 set down to Profit and Loss.”</p>

<p>After fifteen years of married life her husband
died, bequeathing the whole of a large estate to
her, and making her sole guardian of their three
children,—a confidence fully justified by her conduct
of the affairs thus committed to her.</p>

<p>“My husband trained me patiently and thoroughly,”
she said to one who complimented her financial
sagacity. “I was an ignoramus when we were married.”</p>

<p>Then, laughingly, she related the “profit and loss”
incident.</p>

<p>It is the fashion to sneer at women’s business
methods. Who are to blame for their blunders?</p>

<div class="sidenote">MONEY AS A TOY</div>

<p>Should your wife play with her allowance, as a
child with a new toy, let censure fall upon those
who have kept her in leading-strings. Teach her
gradually to comprehend her responsibilities. The
sense of them will steady her unless she be exceptionally
feather-brained. Be she wasteful or frugal, the
allowance you have made to her is as honestly hers
to have, to hold or to spend, as the third of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
estate which the law will give her in the event of
your death.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">SETTLEMENTS</div>

<p>“Settlements,” according to the English sense of
the word, are not yet common in the United States.
One American father, whose daughter was on the
eve of marriage with an Englishman, ordered the
prospective bridegroom out of the house when the
foreigner queried innocently as to the “settlements”
the future father-in-law intended to make upon his
child.</p>

<p>A man with a reputation for fortune-hunting
had nearly rid himself of the slur by insisting that
his fiancée’s large estate should be settled absolutely
upon herself. Her quondam guardian put a
different complexion on the generous act by divulging
the circumstance that the husband, by the same
“settlement,” had made himself sole trustee of his
wife’s property of every description.</p>

<p>While there are, perhaps, fewer purely mercenary
marriages in our country than in any other, it can
not be denied that a large proportion of enterprising
young men act, consciously, or unwittingly, on
the advice of the Scotchman who warned his son
not to marry for money, but in seeking a wife, “to
gae where money is.”</p>

<p>“Is he marrying her fortune, or herself?” asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
one gossip of another when an approaching bridal
was spoken of.</p>

<p>“They <i>say</i> he is very much in love with her!”
was the answer, uttered dubiously. “I fancy, however,
that he would have repressed his passion, if
she were a poor girl.”</p>

<p>Which brings us to a much more delicate matter
than the division of the income earned, or inherited,
by the bridegroom.</p>

<p>It is a fact that may have much significance—or
none—that the bride makes no mention of endowing
her husband with all, or any portion, of her
worldly goods. It is likewise significant that laws
(of man’s devising) take it for granted that her
property goes with her, so that in most of our states
it is his without other act of gift than the marriage
ceremony.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MARRYING FOR MONEY</div>

<p>The man who marries for money has no scruples
as to the acceptance and the use of it. Sometimes
it is squandered; sometimes, but not often, it is
hoarded; most frequently “it goes into the husband’s
business” and is invested by him for the benefit of
himself and his family.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE BRIDE’S DOWRY</div>

<p>The nicer issue with which we have to do is how
our conscientious John, who would have married
his best girl if she had not possessed one penny in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>
her own right, is to comport himself with regard to
the fortune, modest or considerable, which she
brings to him as dowry.</p>

<p>Briefly and clearly—as a trust not to be committed
to the chances and changes of his individual
ventures. No investment should be made of his
wife’s money without her knowledge and full consent.
In all that he does, where her funds are involved,
he should be her actuary, and what profits
result from “operations” with her funds should be
settled on herself and children. By this course alone
can he retain his self-respect, his reputation as an
honorable man, and certainly disabuse his wife’s
mind of any possible suspicion that his affection was
not wholly for her.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XLI<br />

<small>MORE ABOUT ALLOWANCES</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">THE arrangement between husband and wife
concerning money matters should be no more
definite and businesslike than that subsisting between
father and children. To be taught early the
real value of money is a distinct assistance to financial
integrity in later life. To have in one’s possession,
even as a child, a sum wholly one’s own, conduces
to a feeling of self-respect and independence.
As soon as a child is old enough to know what
money is and that, for money, things are bought
and sold, he should have an allowance, be it only a
penny a week. Suggestions, but not commands, as
to its expenditure should accompany the gift. Gradually
the weekly or monthly amount should be increased,
and instructions should be given as to its
possible use.</p>

<p>A child may be advised properly to divide his
small funds between pleasure and charity, or between
the things bought solely for his own benefit
and those for the benefit of others, the value of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
expenditure, in each case, being dependent on the
freedom of his choice. As he grows older he should
be taught to expend money for necessities. He
should be trained to buy his own clothes and other
personal belongings. This sort of training, often
disastrously neglected, is of far more practical value
than many things taught in the schools. The feeling
of responsibility engendered in children or young
people by trusting them with a definite amount of
money for certain general purposes, can scarcely
fail of a happy result. It binds them to a performance
of duty while it confers, at the same time,
a delicious sense of freedom. An allowance for
necessities gives its recipient liberty of choice in expenditure,
but the choice must be judicious or the
recipient suffers. This it does not take him long
to find out.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">RUNNING UP BILLS</div>

<p>Many a man who refuses his sons and daughters
allowances, permits them to run up large bills at
the various shops where they trade. Exactly what
the amount of these bills will be he never knows,
except that it is sure to be larger than he wishes.
The children of such a man never have any ready
money. They do not know what to count on and,
in consequence, not being trusted, they exercise all
their ingenuity to outwit the head of the family and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
to trick from him exactly as much money as
possible. A young woman with somewhat extravagant
tendencies, who belonged to the class of the
unallowanced, begged her father for a new gown.
She pleaded and pleaded in vain. Finally, he said
if she had anything that could be made over, he
would stand for the bill. This word to the wise
was sufficient. She took the waist-band of an old
gown to her modiste who built upon it a beautiful
frock for which she likewise sent in a beautiful bill.
Fortunately, this daughter had a father who was a
connoisseur in wit, and who could appreciate a joke
even at his own expense. But the example will
serve, as well as another, to illustrate the lengths to
which a woman may resort when not treated as a
reasonable and reasoning creature about money
matters.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CONVENIENT ALLOWANCE</div>

<p>“I would rather have one-half the amount of
money of which I might otherwise have the use,
and have it in the form of an allowance,” said a
young woman who was discussing, with other young
women, the subject of expenditures. “If I <i>know</i>
what I am to have, I can spend it to much better
advantage. I can exercise some method in my purchases.
If I don’t know, I am likely to spend a
large sum on some two or three articles with the
hope that more is coming. Suddenly and unexpectedly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
father sets his foot down on further bills,
and there I am with a dream of a hat but no shoes,
or with a ball gown and not a coat to my back.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">LEARNING HOW TO SPEND</div>

<p>Money plays some part in the life of every human
being belonging to a civilized nation. The question
of successful and skilful expenditure is a vital question
for the majority of people. It is not a question
that can be solved without training. Yet we educate
children in various unimportant matters, and,
for the most part, leave this of money untouched.
In no way can a child or a young person be taught
so readily and so quickly the proper use of money
as by limiting his expenses to a certain sum, which
sum he nevertheless controls.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLII<br />

<small>A FEW OF THE LITTLE THINGS THAT ARE BIG THINGS</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">SEEING the prevalence of rudeness in human intercourse,
one is forced to believe that the natural
man is a cross-grained brute. That breeding and
culture often convert him into a creature of gentleness
and refinement speaks volumes for the powers
of such influence. The average man seems to take
a savage delight in occasionally giving vent to brutal
or cutting speech. To yield thus to a primal and
savage instinct is to prove that breeding and refinement
are lacking.</p>

<p>There are certain business men who, during business
hours, meet one with a brusk manner that
would not be pardoned in a petty tradesman. If we
visit them on their own business,—not as intruders,—it
is the same. They seem to feel that a certain
disagreeable humor is an indispensable accompaniment
to the occasion. Such insolence is usually
taken as a matter of course by the recipient, who
immediately feels penitent at the thought of his intrusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>Too often the physician who is not a gentleman
at heart trades on the fact that his patients regard
him as a necessity, and is as disagreeable as his
temper at the moment demands that he shall be.
He intimates that he is so busy that he has scarcely
time to give his advice; that the person he attends
had no business to get ill, and, in fact, makes himself
generally so disagreeable it is to be wondered
at that the sufferer ever calls in this man again.
Yet in a drawing-room, and talking to a well person,
this man’s manner would be charming. One
sometimes feels that sick people and physicians
might well be classed as “patients” and “impatients.”</p>

<p>It is but fair to remark that, to the credit of
physicians, it is not always those who have had the
largest experience, or who stand at the head of
their profession who deserve to come under the
above condemnation. The men to whom the world
looks for advice in the matters of which they have
made a study, and who are sure of their standing,
are often the gentlest, the most courteous.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">COUNTING-ROOM COURTESY</div>

<p>Our busy men have need to remember that the
man who is gentle at heart shows that gentleness in
counting-room and office as well as in drawing-room
and dining-room, and the fact that the person
calling on him for business purposes or advice is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>
woman, should compel him to show the politeness
which</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 3em;">—“is to do and say</span></div>
<div class="verse">The kindest thing in the kindest way.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the other hand, common courtesy and consideration
for another demand that the person who
intrudes on a man when he is busy should state his
business briefly, and then take his departure. Only
the busy man or woman knows the agony that
comes with the knowledge that the precious moments
of the working hours are being frittered away
on that which is unnecessary, when necessary work
is standing by, begging for the attention it deserves
and should receive. Let him who would be careful
on points of etiquette remember that there is an
etiquette of working hours as well as of the hours
of leisure and sociability.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">ASKING QUESTIONS</div>

<p>Perhaps the lapse from good breeding most common
in general society is the asking of questions.
One is aghast at the evidence of impertinent curiosity
that parades under the guise of friendly interest.
Interrogations as to the amount of one’s
income, occupation, and even as to one’s age and
general condition, are legion and inexcusable.
Every one who writes—be he a well-known author
or a penny-a-liner—knows only too well the query,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
“What are you writing now?” and knows, too, the
feeling of impotent rage awakened by this query.
Yet, unless one would be as rude as one’s questioner,
one must smile inanely and make an evasive
answer.</p>

<p>To ask no question does not, of necessity, mean
a lack of interest in the person with whom one is
conversing. A polite and sympathetic attention will
show a more genuine and appreciative interest than
much inquisitiveness.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A lack of interest in what is being told one is a
breach of courtesy that is all too common. Often
one sees a man or woman deliberately pick up a
book or paper, open it and glance over it while his
interlocutor is in the midst of a story he means to
make interesting. If the conversation <i>is</i> interesting,
it deserves the undivided attention of both persons;
if what is being said is not worth attention,
the listener should at least respect the speaker’s intention
to please. There is nothing more dampening
to conversational enthusiasm, or more “squelching”
to eloquence, than to find the eyes of the person
with whom one is talking fixed on a book or
magazine, which he declares he is simply “looking
over,” or at whose pictures he is “only glancing.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GOOD LISTENER</div>

<p>A good listener is in himself an inspiration. Even
if one is not attracted by the person to whom one is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
talking, one should assume interest. This rule also
holds good with regard to the attention given to a
public speaker. In listening to a preacher or to a
lecturer, one should look at him steadily,—not allowing
the eyes to wander about the building and
along the ceiling and walls. This habit of a seemingly
fixed attention is easily cultivated. If one is
really interested in the address, it aids in the enjoyment
and comprehension of it to watch the speaker’s
facial play and gestures. If one is bored, one may
yet fix the eyes upon the face of the person to whom
one is supposed to be listening, and continue to
think one’s own thoughts and to plan one’s own
plans. And certainly the person who is exerting
himself for the entertainment of his audience will
speak better and be more comfortable for the
knowledge that eyes belonging to some one who is
apparently absorbed in his address are fixed upon
him.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">TACTFUL CRITICISM</div>

<p>One of the difficult things to do is to pass a criticism
or make a suggestion as to the speech or manner
of another person. Yet there are times when
to refrain is to do the greatest unkindness to a person
sincerely eager to learn. A happy solution is to
include one’s self if possible in the censure given.
“I’m afraid we were all a little boisterous to-night,”
said a tactful woman of the world to a young girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
who really <i>had</i> been boisterous. She caught the
criticism intended and yet felt no hurt at the
speaker.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">TALKING AT THE TELEPHONE</div>

<p>Conditions under which otherwise polite persons
feel that they can be rude are those attendant on
a telephone conversation. With the first word many
a man drops his courtesy as if it were a garment
that did not fit him. And women do the same.
If “Central” were to record all that she (it seems
to be usually a “she”) hears, and all that is said
to her, our ears would tingle. True it is, that she
sometimes is surly, pert and ill-mannered. But
if she is ill-bred, that is no reason for the person
talking to follow suit. Were one really amenable
to arrest for profanity over the wires, the police
would be kept busy if they performed their duty.</p>

<p>But putting aside the underbred who swears, let
us listen for a moment to the so-called courteous
person,—for he is courteous under ordinary circumstances:</p>

<div class="sidenote">SCOLDING CENTRAL</div>

<p>“Hello! Central! how long are you going to
keep me waiting? I told you I wanted ‘3040
Spring.’ Yes! I did say <i>that!</i> and if you would
pay attention to your business you would know
it! I never saw such a worthless set as they have
at that Central Office. Got them, did you? It’s
time! Hello, 3040, is that you? Well, why the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
devil didn’t you send that stuff around this morning?
Going to, right away, are you? Well, it’s
time you did. What ails you people, anyway?
<i>No!! Central!!!</i> I’m not through, and I wish to
heaven you’d let this line alone when I’m talking,”
and so on, ad infinitum.</p>

<p>Is all this worth while, and is it necessary? And
must women, who, as they call themselves ladies,
do not give vent to expressed profanity, so far
copy the manners of the so-called stronger sex that
they scream like shrews over the telephone?</p>

<p>Calling one day on a woman whom I had met
with pleasure half a dozen times, I was the unwilling
listener to her conversation with her grocer.
She began by rating Central for not asking
“What number?” as soon as the receiver was lifted
from the hook. Having warmed up to business
on this unseen girl, she got still more heated with
the grocer at the other end of the wire. She had
ordered one kind of apples, and he had sent her
another, and the slip of paper containing the list
of her purchases had an item of a five-cent box
of matches that she had not ordered. With regard
to all of which she expostulated shrilly and
with numerous exclamations that were as near as
she dared come to masculine explosives,—such as
“Great Heavens!” “Goodness gracious!” and so
forth. After threatening to transfer her custom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
to another grocer, and refusing to accept the apology
of the abject tradesman, she compromised by
saying that she would give him another trial, and
hung up the receiver, coming into the parlor and
beginning a conversation once more in the even
society voice I had invariably heard before from
her.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COURTESY PAYS</div>

<p>That the ways of telephones and the persons who
operate them are sometimes trying, no one can
deny,—least of all, the writer of this chapter, who
lives in a house with one of these maddening essentials
to human comfort. But the loss of temper
that manifests itself in the outward speech is not
a requisite of the proper appreciation and use of
the telephone. It is nothing less than a habit, and
a pernicious one,—this way we have of talking
into the transmitter. Let us remember that courtesy
pays better than curses, and politeness better
than profanity. If not, then let us have poorer
service from Central and preserve our self-respect.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Never speak of calling a friend on the “phone.”
The abbreviation is vulgar though one sometimes
hears it on the lips of delightful people. But one
should not make the mistake of justifying a solecism
by saying “Mrs. So-and-so says it!” To study
the graces and avoid the blunders of other people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
should be the aim of those who aspire to be well-bred.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">IN MARKET AND SHOP</div>

<p>The breeding of a woman is often shown by the
manner she uses when shopping or marketing.
Courtesy to clerks, to tradesmen of every sort is
the mark of a “lady,” the word used in that beautiful
old-fashioned sense to which, alas! we have
grown a little callous. While a customer has the
right measurably to see what a shop affords before
she makes her choice, she has no right to give a
clerk the trouble of taking out everything when
she has no intention of buying. If she gives much
trouble before her decision as to a purchase is
reached she should thank the clerk in charge for his
extra labor. The fact that he is paid for his time
does not make this duty the less.</p>

<p>Altercations with clerks and other subordinates
in a shop are in execrable taste, are often a sign
of an hysterical as well as a choleric temper.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If women should be considerate in their manner
toward employees of the shops where they trade,
it is quite as true that clerks should be trained to
civility by their employers. For instance, a part
of the duty of clerks is, of course, to keep watch
over the articles sold. To do this it is not necessary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
however, to watch the customer as if she were a
prospective thief. This attitude on the part of the
clerk is not pleasant for the customer and does not
encourage trade.</p>

<div class="sidenote">UNWISE ENDEARMENTS</div>

<p>The suspicious attitude is, however, no worse
than the familiar one employed by some of the
young women serving in shops. A clerk who urges
a customer to buy because the article in question
has proved so satisfactory in her own family, or
the young woman who calls one “dearie” or “honey”
as she fits a cloak upon one or manipulates one’s
millinery, makes a mistake. The relation between
clerk and customer should be always formal and
courteous on both sides.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Marketing is a branch of shopping in which
many women not fundamentally ill-natured, have
the appearance of being so. There is a kind of
ugly scrutiny which many women apply to the inspection
of vegetables, meat and other edibles that
is most unattractive. If these women had an idea
of the way they look when they bend their hard
cold eyes upon the innocent vegetables and fruits,
they would, at any cost, cultivate a more agreeable
manner. Beware of the marketing stare. As for
a string bag, if you have one put it in the furnace.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A rudeness of which people who should know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
better are frequently guilty is that of criticizing
a dear friend of the person to whom one is talking.
This is not only ill-mannered, but unkind,
and one of many flagrant violations of the Golden
Rule. If a man loves his friend, do not call his
attention to that friend’s failings, nor twit him on
his fondness for such a person. He is happier for
not seeing the failings, and if the friendship brings
him any happiness, or makes life even a little pleasanter
for him, do not be guilty of the cruelty of
clouding that happiness. If the man does see the
faults of him he loves, and loyally ignores them,
pretend that you are not aware of the foibles toward
which he would have you believe him blind. The
knowledge of the peccadillos of those in whom we
trust comes only too soon; we need not hurry on the
always disappointing, often bitter knowledge.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">NEVER PATRONIZE</div>

<p>Perhaps lack of breeding shows in nothing more
than in the manner of receiving an invitation.
Should a man say, patronizingly, “Oh, perhaps I
can arrange to come,”—when you invite him to
some function, write him down as unworthy of
another invitation. He is lacking in respect to you
and in appreciation of the honor you confer on him
in asking him to partake of the hospitality you have
devised.</p>

<p>“Really,” protests one man plaintively, “I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
very tired! I have been out every night for two
weeks, and now you want me for to-morrow night.
I am doubtful whether I ought to come. I am
so weary that I feel I need rest.”</p>

<p>The stately woman who had asked him to her
house, smiled amusedly:</p>

<p>“Pray let me settle your doubts for you,” she
said, “and urge you not to neglect the rest nature
demands. Your first duty is to her, not to me.”</p>

<p>The man was too obtuse or too conceited to
perceive the veiled sarcasm, and to know that the
invitation was withdrawn.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">ACKNOWLEDGING FAVORS</div>

<p>Unless one receives special permission from the
person giving an invitation to hold the matter open
for some good and sufficient reason, one should accept
or decline a verbal invitation as soon as it is
given. If circumstances make this impossible, one
should apologize for hesitating, saying, “I am so
anxious to come that I am going to ask your
permission to send you my answer later, after I
ascertain if my husband has no engagement for that
evening,”—or some such form. The hostess will
readily grant such a request.</p>

<p>It may seem far-fetched to speak of ingratitude
as a breach of etiquette, but the lack of acknowledgment
of favors is very much like it. The man who
accepts all done for him as his due, who forgets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
the “thank you” in return for the trifling favors,
is not a gentleman—in that respect, at least. The
young men and young women of to-day are too
often spoiled or heedless, taking pretty attentions
offered them as matters of course, and as their
right.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In this miscellaneous chapter it may be well to
enforce what is said elsewhere with regard to the
respect every man should show to women. For
instance, every man who really respects the women
of his family will remove his hat when he enters
the house. There are, however, men who kiss
these same women with covered heads.</p>

<p>In a well-known play acted by a traveling company
some years ago in a small town, the hero,
standing in a garden, told the heroine he loved
her, was accepted by her, and bent to kiss her
without removing the conventional derby from his
blond pate. All sentiment was destroyed for the
spectators when irate Hibernian accents sounded
forth from the gallery with: “Suppose ye take off
yer hat, ye ill-mannered blokey!”</p>

<p>The Irishman was in the right.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">A WORD TO THE SHY</div>

<p>I would say a word to those who, through bashfulness
or self-consciousness, do the things they
ought not to do and leave undone those things which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
they ought to do. They are so uncomfortable in
society, so afraid of not appearing as they should,
and so much absorbed in wondering how they look
and act, and wishing that they did better, that they
are guilty of the very acts of omission and commission
they would guard against.</p>

<p>If I could give one rule to the bashful it would
be: Forget yourself and your affairs in interest in
others and their affairs. Be so fully occupied noticing
how well others appear and trying to make
everybody about you comfortable, that you have
no time to think of your behavior. You will then
not be guilty of any flagrant breach of etiquette.
The most courteous women I have ever known,
those whose manners were a charm to all whom
they met, were those who were self-forgetful and
always watching for opportunities to make other
people comfortable. Such are the queens of society.</p>

<div class="sidenote">UNDUE SELF-CRITICISM</div>

<p>If you do make a mistake take consolation from
the fact—which will be apparent to you in time—that
others do the same. Perfect good breeding
is a state to which few attain absolutely. One
should not make one’s self thoroughly unhappy by
too constant self-criticism, for to do this is to disobey—paradoxically—a
fundamental social law.
The old negro who, when asked to describe what
he meant by “quality folks,” expressed this law when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">[413]</a></span>
he answered, “Quality never doubts theirselves.”
The beginner <i>must</i> doubt, but he should not agonize
about it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">TALKING SHOP</div>

<p>“Talking shop” is usually alluded to as a decided
breach of etiquette. In many cases it is so,
yet there are people who are never so entertaining
as when doing this very thing, and there are
companies in which it is entirely proper they
should do it. One must use discretion. Certainly,
no one should be forced to talk of his daily work
if he evidently prefers not to do so. Physicians
in particular should not be compelled to play the
professional when they are trying to relax socially.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A party is not the place for propaganda. The
hostess who may be an ardent advocate of votes
for women should be sure that all her guests share
her views before she dogmatically propounds them.
She may indeed politely introduce the topic and
if she merely does this, no one present has a right
to take offense or should hesitate in the same spirit
to speak of her own view. But the subject is likely
to prove dangerous. The writer has seen charming
women utterly lose control of themselves and
all but maul one another over a “discussion” on
equal suffrage.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A social mistake to be avoided is that of being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">[414]</a></span>
“touchy.” To be so occasions one great unhappiness
and leads to serious mistakes in conduct.
Do not allow yourself to find slights and affronts
in the demeanor of those with whom you are
thrown unless there is real foundation for the feeling.
The mental attitude of fancying that others
intend to wound us grows if it is indulged in and
finally leaves us hopelessly out of key.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">CORDIAL GREETINGS</div>

<p>One of the most valuable of social acquisitions
is the habit of greeting people in a delightful way.
Learn to say “Good morning!” audibly, heartily,
as if you meant it. Unless one means to be very
informal one should add the name, “Good morning,
Miss Smith.” We all know men and women
who possess this grace of salutation which lingers
happily on those on whom it is bestowed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In meeting people for the first time one should
take pains to get their names exactly right. There
is something very personal in one’s feeling about
one’s name and one has a right to have it spoken
and written as one elects. If a man is named “Davies”
he can not be blamed for resenting it if people
indifferently address him as “Mr. Davis.” If
people who make introductions would take more
trouble to speak the name distinctly, this would
help greatly. If the name is indistinctly uttered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">[415]</a></span>
you may say, “Pardon me, I did not understand
the name?” which will generally bring forth
a clear repetition.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Small matters, such as quiet breathing, betoken
gentlehood. Flowers, if one is inhaling their perfume,
should be treated delicately,—the face should
not be buried in them. Remember Browning’s
word,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
<div class="verse"><span style="margin-left: 6em;">“Any nose</span></div>
<div class="verse">May ravage with impunity a rose.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It is frequently said that the weather, as a topic
of conversation, is tabooed. But how charmingly
Chesterton has defended it: “There are very deep
reasons for talking about the weather ... it is
a gesture of primeval worship ... to begin with
the weather is a pagan way of beginning with
prayer. Then it is an expression of that elementary
idea in politeness—equality ... in that we all
have our hats under the dark blue spangled umbrella
of the universe.” Surely after reading so
fine a plea, no one need fear to begin the morning’s
conversation with a word on the weather!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">GETTING OFF A STREET-CAR</div>

<p>One of the things that most women need to
learn is the correct way of getting off a street-car,
which is to step off with the right foot, facing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
front, which saves awkwardness in every case and
sometimes, if the car starts too soon, an accident.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nothing more absolutely marks a lady than her
manner toward her social inferior. She is kindly
but never patronizing. A woman who was once
being fitted for new shoes and who had inquired
of the clerk who waited on her how his family
were—the man had been at his post for many
years and she called him by name—turned to a
woman acquaintance who was waiting her turn
and said, explanatorily, “I always speak to the
butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker.” If
this was her custom, why apologize for it?</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">AT THE HOTEL TABLE</div>

<p>When strangers are served at the same table in
a hotel, they should bow and say “Good morning”
or “Good evening,” on sitting down and on leaving.
This polite custom, often ignored in America,
is universal abroad.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If one wishes to ask a social favor such as a
card for a friend to a ball to which you yourself
have been asked, or a letter of introduction, it is
better to make the request by note if possible, as
this gives the other person more freedom to refuse
if that seems necessary.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When one alludes to an entire family by name,
respect requires that the article “the” be prefixed.
One’s friends are “the Smiths,” “the Browns,” etc.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">OVERWHELMING COMPLIMENTS</div>

<p>Profuse compliment is as much to be avoided
as undue or untactful criticism. We are annoyed
by those who persistently overwhelm us with admiring
comment. On the other hand, one should
not hesitate to speak a sincere word that will give
pleasure; one may without apology tell a friend
that her new hat is unusually becoming or her
dress artistic. There are people who pride themselves
on “never saying anything disagreeable” and
they succeed in being so very often and quite unconsciously
because they lack savor. Arthur Benson,
the English essayist, has amusingly pointed
out how dull society would be if we turned it into
a chorus of indiscriminate praise of how delightful
A is, what a charming person is B, how altogether
lovely is C. Perhaps the wisest rule is to draw
a sharp line between those who are entitled in a
strict sense to the all-devoted attitude of affection
and those whom we merely like and find entertaining.
Even the most patent faults and shortcomings
of the former must be sacred—“A friend
conceals the weaknesses of a friend.” Of the second
class one may speak frankly though of course
always in taste and without malice.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIII<br />

<small>ON MANNER</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">WHILE it is important to master the minutiæ
that govern the conduct of social life,
it is well to remember that a good manner is to
be desired even above good manners. “Not what
she says but the way she says it” was the clever
explanation made by an experienced society woman
of the charm of a débutante. If one doubts this
for a moment, one has only to recall the impression
made now and then by a fine-mannered workman
or a country woman who has never attended
a “function” in her life. Such persons, by virtue
of a native dignity of bearing, by a beautiful simplicity
and a kindness of heart toward all men,
would be at home in any assembly worthy to receive
them. One can fancy that Stella, whom Dean
Swift loved, would have been at ease in any society,
even had she lacked her protector’s instruction and
fostering care. We are told that she has civility,
repose and humor, three great qualities that make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
for social success. A well-known woman, describing
those who possess savoir-faire, says: “They
have the genius of tact to perceive, the genius of
finesse to execute, ease and frankness of manner,
a knowledge of the world that nothing can surprise,
a calmness of temper that nothing can disturb,
and a kindness of disposition that can never
be exhausted.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">LEARNING TO TALK WELL</div>

<p>To learn to talk well and to listen well and to
do either with grace as the conversational situation
demands is a real accomplishment. One writer on
the subject of conversation has given excellent advice:
“Socialize every thought before you utter it.”
In other words, one should bear in mind as vividly
as possible the probable direction and extent of the
sympathies and interests of the person to whom
one is speaking and endeavor not to let his words
go far afield from those sympathies and interests.
Conversation is essentially a partnership game and,
as in playing golf, the one who is talking should
not get too far away from his listener. There have
been people like Coleridge who did not converse
but who spoke habitually in monologues and spoke
so brilliantly that society was glad to listen. With
ordinary men and women, however, there should
be give and take. In listening, try to catch plumply
a ball tossed to you and in return try to pitch your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
own ball neither too high nor too low, too soft
nor too hard.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">USING THE QUESTION FORM</div>

<p>It is not necessary, in order to be pleasant, to
make one’s self what Emerson has happily called
“a mush of concession.” Do not be afraid to have
convictions of your own and at the proper moment
to express them clearly. At the same time, one
should avoid a dogmatic manner and any assumption
that one’s own view is the only view worth having.
The saying “Stick your opinions in nobody’s
sleeve” is to the point. Utter your own ideas
frankly but do not force their acceptance on any
one. Even a good idea is likely to lose by any
suggestion of insistence. It is well to make frequent
use of the question form in beginning a new
topic of discussion, to ask, “Do you admire Forbes-Robertson?”
rather than “I admire Forbes-Robertson
because, etc.” In the one case, you courteously
include in your talk the one whom you are addressing,
and, in the other, you simply use him as an
audience for your own benefit. People who are
given to the latter form are usually those who are
fond of talking constantly which—it may be remarked—is
a dangerous thing to do. The man or
woman who says a great deal at one time is pretty
sure to say something he will be sorry for. Besides,
from a strategic point of view, the man who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
is always talking himself does not learn; he has
no chance to be finding where the other person
stands, while, all the time, he is setting himself
up as a target. A great teacher once said, “A wise
man will hear and will increase learning.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">A LOVE OF HARMONY</div>

<p>Not to talk constantly of one’s self and one’s
affairs is, of course, a fundamental rule of good
breeding and yet there are persons who know how
to talk about themselves—on occasions when it is
proper to do so—in a delightful way, because they
have the instinct for speaking simply and without
conceit. To speak of one’s ills of any sort is
ordinarily a mistake. “Consume your own smoke.”
“To walk gently, humbly, and, if possible, gaily
with other men” is a charming rule for social conduct.
One should be a lover of harmony. To
differ abruptly from the one who is speaking may,
in rare instances, be necessary, but only then. After
all, the person who is “agreeable” is one who agrees.
While one may not share one’s neighbor’s views
in the whole, one may often seize on some point
of it with which to sympathize and on which to
set the seal of one’s approval. The clergyman who,
at an evening party where a well-known woman
had read a paper on Sir Oliver Lodge and his experiments
in the occult, vehemently denounced all
occultism, doubtless felt that his office demanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
this attitude, but he made his hostess and the other
guests exceedingly uncomfortable.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE CANDLES OF CONVERSATION</div>

<p>Avoid the unfortunate habit that some persons
have of snuffing out the candles of conversation.
If any one introduces a topic, the reasonable inference
is that he is interested in that topic and
remark number two from you should not throw
cold water on it. Do not merely listen, but attend,
stretch mentally toward your companion, be with
him in thought. “Find out where people are and
meet them there.” Only in this way will you yourself
gain the full measure of what the other person
has to give and be able to reply to the finer points
of his remark. A good rule in conversation is
“when in doubt keep still.” Never be betrayed into
talking merely because you are nervous. Arthur
Vincent speaks somewhere of the unhappy spectacle
made by the shy man who attempts to cover
his shyness by garrulity. When you do speak, take
all the time there is. That is to say, do not feel
hurried or flurried. Speak when you speak—without
fear and with dignity. Never press unduly
any slight advantage you may acquire in conversation.
Your companion is not your victim nor are
you to shine as his superior. A fine manner is
made up of many slight sacrifices.</p>

<p>If, in spite of yourself, you are drawn into a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">[423]</a></span>
heated, wordy and futile argument, you are justified
in assenting to any claims whatsoever your unwise
companion may make. It was the practise of
Stella, says one of her biographers, to agree with
such persons, as she said, “to save noise.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">THE TELLING OF STORIES</div>

<p>If you attempt to tell a story, be sure, in the first
place, that it is worth telling, and in the second
place, that you know it thoroughly, and in the third
place, that you tell it reasonably well. But the social
company that is transformed into a succession of
“good stories” does not represent the highest social
plane. A particularly good story is always desirable
if it comes in naturally to point some phase of
a discussion that is in progress, but a run of stories
represents an intellectual descent. In whatever you
are telling or describing, beware of too much detail.
Remember the French proverb, “To tell all is to be
tedious.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">SERENITY AND GENTLENESS</div>

<p>Cheerfully accord the other person the last word
in any discussion, giving your own view once quietly
and if it does not arouse interest, do not insist on
it. Never raise your voice to command attention.
Never spoil a fine moment by any disagreeable
allusions. There are always some people who have
a gift for introducing the subject of ptomaine poisoning
during the fish course, or who, on an outing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">[424]</a></span>
make all the other women uncomfortable by talking
about snakes. Remember that comparisons are
dangerous and that superlatives are also often the
forerunner of embarrassment. Be prepared for
surprises and do not allow them to throw you off
your balance. Never allow yourself to become a
fussbudget. Serenity is one great element of social
charm. Du Maurier tells us that Trilby knew
“when to speak and when to keep silence.” George
Meredith, in his delightful romance, <i>Sandra Belloni</i>,
says of Sandra, “She moved softly as if she
loved everything that she touched.” A certain softness
of manner is undoubtedly a large part of
attractiveness, but the sharp edge of self-assertion
destroys. The gentleness of Hamlet’s unhappy love
is shown in the warning spoken before one of her
entrances: “Soft you now, the fair Ophelia.”
“Remember,” says a modern writer on voice training:
“that every time you speak you touch some
one with your voice.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Beware of giving out violent opinions before
knowing where the other person stands. This does
not mean that you should be untrue to your own
beliefs, but that you should, with one newly met,
cast about for at least a plank on which you two
may stand in friendly relation. It is the people
who most accurately measure the common ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
between them and other people who make the most
and the happiest friendships.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Never command even one who is paid to serve
you. The same words put in the form of a request
are equally effective and are much more creditable
to you and grateful to the persons to whom they
are spoken. English servants invariably say
“Thank you” for any information or direction
given them, but this smacks of servility and one
hopes the custom will not be taken up in this country.</p>

<p>Never begin a conversation with “Say,” as “Say,
Marjorie.” In a group conversation be careful to
include, by voice and glance, every one in it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SAY GOOD-BY TO ALL</div>

<p>Finally, be sure, as Emerson says, “that people
like a room better with you in it than out of it,”
and when you leave the room, learn to do it in a
way that adds to the pleasure your presence has
already given. Do not, for one thing, neglect to
say good-by to every one present if the number
is small. The grace with which some people take
leave amounts to an art. Some one has recorded
with delight “the exquisite, laughing farewells” of
Mrs. Browning.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIV<br />

<small>SELF-HELP AND OBSERVATION</small></h2>


<p class="drop-cap">TO the uninstructed, socially, the bare rules
and conventions regulating social life seem
often meaningless and arbitrary. A careful consideration
of these conventions, such as it has been
the aim of this book to give, shows that no one of
them is without a reason for its being. The classification,
however, of social forms, together with the
reasons governing these forms, does not provide a
body of knowledge sufficient to serve as guide in
the matter of comporting one’s self easily and to
advantage socially. There are many situations and
points of behavior that it is impossible for a book
of etiquette to cover. The laws laid down are only
a small social capital. They discuss the more obvious
matters of social contact. Numerous points,—and
these of the finer sort,—must be left without
comment. In the treatment of these points and
problems the person desirous of solving them properly
must rely largely on his own good sense. One
must apply to social exigencies the same methods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
of reasoning that one applies in meeting the other
exigencies of life. In a word, one must resort to
the principle of self-help.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LEARN BY OBSERVATION</div>

<p>Much, too, and this in the pleasantest fashion,
may be done to extend one’s knowledge of good
form by observation of people who have unusual
tact and social discrimination. In every city, town
and village, there are such persons who are distinguished
above their fellow citizens by social instinct,
by the talent for performing gracefully and
acceptably the offices of society. In differing
degrees, but still perceptibly, these people, like the
painter, the musician, the poet, are marked by a
taste and a thirst for perfection. To render social
life as interesting, as charming, as beautiful as possible,
to make the social machinery run smoothly
and without friction,—this is their aim. Such
people give quality to social intercourse. They observe
the little amenities of life with grace. They
know how to enter a room and how to leave it.
They convey by the bow with which they greet one
on the street the proper degree of acquaintanceship
or friendship. They dress with propriety. They
take time by the forelock in the adoption of new
devices for the entertainment of their friends.
Their parties are the prettiest; their houses are the
most popular. Not necessarily clever of speech,
they are clever in small and charming activities.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
They have a marked talent for all the little graces
that make social intercourse easy and delightful.
This talent, of course, can not be communicated,
but much may be learned by watching its operation.
Certainly one can gain from it a knowledge of particulars,
of how to perform certain definite acts,
even if the conquest of the method is impossible.</p>

<p>It is not difficult in any community to discover
people who approach more or less nearly the type
described. They have a recognized distinction. To
watch them, and, by this means, to wrest from them
a part at least of their secret, is the surest way for
the individual, timid or unversed socially, to discover
his own social power and to increase it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="sidenote">TRIFLES MAKE PERFECTION</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE UNIFORMITY OF CUSTOM</div>

<p>Doubtless some of those who read this book may
be disposed to ask why, in social life, so much stress
is laid on comparatively small matters and why one
can not do as one pleases? To these we recommend
Gilbert Hamerton’s delightful essay, <i>Custom
and Tradition</i>, addressed “To a young gentleman
who had firmly resolved never to wear anything
but a gray coat.” We quote briefly: “The penalties
imposed by society for the infraction of very
trifling details of custom are often, as it seems,
out of all proportion to the offense; but so are the
penalties of nature.... Nature <i>will</i> be obeyed.
Society will be obeyed.... Society does not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
desire to exclude you because you will not wear
evening dress; but the dress is customary, and your
exclusion is merely a consequence of your non-conformity.
The view of society goes no farther
in this than the artistic conception (not very delicately
artistic, perhaps) that it is prettier to see
men in black coats regularly placed between ladies
round a dinner-table than men in gray coats or
brown coats. The uniformity of custom appears
to represent uniformity of sentiment.... Society
does not argue the point with you, but only excludes
you.”</p>
